        "text": "Syria crisis : Fresh clashes in Aleppo The BBC 's Ian Pannell and cameraman Darren Conway were trapped by fighting in Aleppo . \nTheir report contains graphic images of victims There have been fresh reports of clashes and attacks by helicopter gunships in Aleppo as the Syrian army offensive enters its fourth day . \nState TV said Syrian forces were inflicting heavy losses on `` terrorist groups '' in Aleppo and also claimed government successes in Homs . \nThousands of refugees are continuing to flee Aleppo - Syria 's commercial hub . \nMeanwhile the US and Turkey have agreed to step up efforts to achieve `` political transition '' in Syria . \nThis would include the departure of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , the White House said . \nAccording to Syrian TV , government troops have been gaining ground in several Aleppo neighborhoods . \nOn Monday , it reported that the army had won complete control over Salah al-Din , one of the areas of Aleppo where rebel fighters from the Free Syrian Army had become entrenched . \nAnalysts say Salah al-Din provides an important route for Syrian troop reinforcements coming from the south . \nBut activists and rebel commanders denied that government forces had gained ground there . \nRebel fighters are outgunned by Syrian government forces but do have some anti-aircraft weapons They report renewed heavy shelling and helicopter gunship attacks there and in other rebel-held areas on Tuesday , especially around the Sakhour quarter on the north-east side of Aleppo . \nFierce fighting also taken place near the headquarters of the feared Air Force Intelligence agency to the west of the city , they say . \nState television completely ignored events in Aleppo in its early morning news programs on Tuesday , the BBC 's Jim Muir in Beirut says . \nInstead , it broadcast a detailed report from Homs , where it said the quarter of Qarabis , which has long been held by rebel fighters , had finally fallen to government forces . \nBut later bulletins carried reports of Syrian forces inflicting heavy losses on '' terrorist groups '' in Aleppo districts . \nCorrespondents say neither side can afford to lose Aleppo , Syria 's largest city and is the country 's industrial and financial center . \nUntil this month it had been spared the daily bloodshed seen in other cities since the uprising began in March 2011 . \nSupplies are now reported to be running out in certain areas and those citizens remaining in the city face long queues for bread . \nMelissa Fleming , a spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency , the UNHCR , said thousands of frightened residents had sought shelter from the fighting in schools , mosques and public buildings . \n`` These are the people who have n't fled the city , have n't had the means or feel that it 's too dangerous to make that journey , '' she said . \n`` There are 32 schools in Aleppo that we 've identified and in each of those schools , we have heard , or we have witnessed , that 250-300 people were packed inside , many of these families , kids . '' \nIn a phone call on Monday , US President Barack Obama and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to help the growing numbers of refugees - both inside Syria and in neighbouring countries . \nTurkey has been a staunch critic of President Assad and has given refuge to large numbers of army defectors . \nThousands of Syrian refugees are also living in refugee camps on the Turkish side of the countries ' long border . \nSource : UNHCR , 31 July 2012 Those arriving from Aleppo in recent days have spoken of incessant shelling . \nAs the crisis deepened , Iran - a close ally of Damascus - warned Turkey not to intervene militarily , the Syrian state-controlled al-Watan newspaper said . \n`` Any attack on Syrian territory will meet with a harsh response , and the Iranian-Syrian mutual defense agreement will be activated , '' it reported on Monday . \nThe newspaper said Turkey and the US were planning to create `` a safe haven guarded by the armed gangs '' in the north of Syria . \n`` Turkey has received very strong warnings in the past few hours and the following message - beware changing the rules of the game , '' al-Watan said . \nTurkey has said it will use troops if necessary to prevent another Halabja - a reference to a notorious massacre in Saddam Hussein 's Iraq . \nGreek officials were due to reveal further details of new border security plans on Tuesday , aimed at stopping Syrian refugees crossing from Turkey . \nOn Monday , Greece - one of the busiest entry points for illegal immigrants entering the EU - said it was quadrupling the number of guards along its border with Turkey . \nIn New York , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon repeated that he was particularly concerned by the continued use of heavy weapons by Syrian government forces . \nHe also called on the Syrian government to renounce the possibility of using chemical weapons under any circumstances , and to secure its stockpiles . \nDamascus has implicitly acknowledged its possession of chemical weapons but said it would not use them against its own people , only against foreign invaders . \nIf you are happy to be contacted by a BBC journalist please leave a telephone number that we can contact you on . \nIn some cases a selection of your comments will be published , displaying your name as you provide it and location , unless you state otherwise . \nYour contact details will never be published . \nWhen sending us pictures , video or eyewitness accounts at no time should you endanger yourself or others , take any unnecessary risks or infringe any laws . \nPlease ensure you have read the terms and conditions . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .",

        "text": "With Mexico saying the worst may be over and the new H1N1 virus starting to look more like a seasonal flu strain in the United States and elsewhere , critics are going to start asking if public health officials overreacted to the outbreak . \nSince the new swine flu virus was first identified two weeks ago in two children in Texas and California , the World Health Organization pushed its pandemic alert level from a three to a five , meaning a pandemic is imminent . \nMexico closed schools , stopped public events and took a big hit to tourism . \nThe U.S. government mobilized 25 percent of its stockpile of antiviral drugs and started work on a vaccine against the new strain . \nBut the death toll is being rolled back as Mexican officials realize it will be impossible to know if long-buried or cremated victims died of H1N1 swine flu . \nAnd while the infection is spreading rapidly across the United States , it appears to be no worse than seasonal flu . \nScientists who study flu say the coordinated , global response was appropriate . \n`` If it does n't become more virulent , first of all , many people will heave a great sigh of relief , '' said Dr. Scott Lillibridge , who helped set up the Center for Disease Control and Prevention 's Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Program and who is now at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston . \nBut Lillibridge echoes what the WHO and CDC have been saying : viruses mutate and change all the time and it is too early to say how bad this virus really is . \n`` We are only a few days into a major international mobilization for an outbreak that could continue months into the future , '' Lillibridge said in a telephone interview . \nThe U.S. government has been preparing for this scenario for years . \nOne of the messages that has come up repeatedly is that the 1918 pandemic , cited as the worst-case scenario because it killed upwards of 40 million people , started with a mild arrival of a new virus , now identified as H1N1 , in the spring . \nIt disappeared over the summer , but roared back with a vengeance in August . \n`` Will there be later disease , and if so , will it be more severe ? '' \nCDC acting director Dr. Richard Besser asked on Monday . \n`` There is no doubt in my mind that CDC , the Department of Homeland Security , and the Health and Human Services Department will use the lull to get ready , '' said risk communications consultant Peter Sandman , who has taken a special interest in pandemic flu . \n`` They will stay focused on this problem . \nThey will continue to get ready for a possible pandemic in the fall . '' \nMany public health experts also remember the 1976 swine flu outbreak that was n't . \nManufacturers raced to make a vaccine and 40 million Americans were vaccinated amid a monster public relations campaign . \nBut the flu never spread . \n`` One big difference between then and now was that when the swine flu was detected in 1976 , it was found at a single military installation in Ft. . \nDix , New Jersey , '' said Dr. Harvey Fineberg , president of the Institute of Medicine and author of `` The Epidemic that Never Was . '' \n`` In the ensuing weeks and months it was not detected elsewhere -- not elsewhere in New Jersey , not elsewhere in the United States , not elsewhere in the rest of the world . '' \nWorse yet , some people developed a rare neurological reaction to the vaccine called Guillain-Barre syndrome . \nEven now , a considerable minority of people believe that vaccines are harmful . \nIn contrast , said Fineberg , this virus spread globally in a matter of weeks , carried by holidaymakers and jet travel , and has shown it can be transmitted from one person to another . \n`` Last week the lesson is we got lucky , '' said Sandman . \n`` We have no reason to think we will stay lucky . '' \nHe hopes the alarm bells will continue to ring , at an appropriate level . \n`` I just hope the government is more worried about the public being caught with its pants down than the government being called fearmongerers , '' Sandman said . \n`` One thing we have learned about flu is we should not be surprised by anything , '' he said . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform",

\nFor the people of Egypt , I wish for a non-violent revolution , ending in a shape of government to their liking . \nThe problem with modern democracy in many states around the world , is that to become a leader , you need money . \nA lot of money . \nObamas campaign costs added up to 750 million $ ... Where is the democracy in this ? \nHow can the working man compete with it ? \nModern democracy is a pyramid of money , which looks a lot like the medieval feudal system , and until we , the people say no , it will keep looking like this . \nPeace to Egypt an power to the people February 1st , 2011 6:29 am ET Guys , it is not about USA or the west is particular , it is about the freedom , liberty and accountability which seem that those things are not available in the Middle East . \nBut go back to Egypt where I came from Egyptians suffers for the last 60 years of corruption , dishonesty , suppression , manipulative media , lack of economic planning and dictatorship in each of those underqualified leaders and their regimes . \nThe Egyptian constitution becomes an ill piece of legislation which has no relation to the fundamentals of the word constitution !! After too many changes to suit Mubarak and before him , Saddat and before Saddat was Naser , Sorry , at Naser s time there was no Constitution !! He did not need one because he knew it all and that was the beginning of the dark days for Egyptians . \nTo John , I would like to say that ElBaradei is not a puppet to USA and he is an honest Egyptian , well educated and graduated from the law school in Cairo university and has a PhD in international law and I wish that he takes over an interim government until a proper Constitution get drafted to suit the people not the ruler !! What Egyptians need is responsible government to be accountable to its work and not a life time ruler . \nAbout the Moslim brotherhood , those people are not the as the media portraying them , it is just way of holding on power by indicating that if the Angle Mubarak goes the west will face the mighty extremists !! So the devil you know better than the devil you do not , and that is a naive approach from the west and I have to say that this is nonsense . \nFor the rest of the Middle Eastern countries I wish you wake up too . \nFortunately , in the `` world '' I live in , there is exposure to many information sources and media with every opinion under the sun . \nConsequently , one can develop one 's own ideas dismissing any attempt at manipulation and propaganda in the process . \nThose are the advantages of a democratic society with the institutions necessary to protect its citizens from descent into anarchy and chaos . \nFebruary 1st , 2011 11:18 am ET Sayed K , thanks for your post . \nYou say ElBaradei is not a puppet to USA . \nYou say he 's only going to form a unity government until free elections are possible . \nMy dear friend that s exactly what they said about Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan . \nElBaradei is a UN man . \nWhat good has the UN been for the middle east ? \nPlease understand the IMF ordered Egypt to cut food subsidies . \nThey new this would cause riots . \nAnd just after they cut the subsidies ElBaradei flew in from the west . \nMubarak has been a puppet for America , and he held you down with bullets made in the USA . \nBut he is old and needs to be replaced . \nSo in comes ElBaradei . \nThe Muslim brotherhood has been funded by Britains MI5 since 1926 . \nThe British and Americans want revolution to sweep the middle east . \nThey hope your countries can be divided into smaller blocks like North and South Sudan . \nThe want a new united Arab regime in Saudi and Egypt to fight Iran . \nThe Egyptians on the street were never calling for ElBaradei . \nMost Egyptians on the street have limited access to modern communications and know little of ElBaradei . \nAsk the people who they want , do accept what the TV tells you is the people choice . \nFebruary 1st , 2011 11:21 am ET Ask the people who they want , do NOT accept what the TV tells you is the people choice . \nIt is quite likely that most of the 80 million Egyptians are satisfied with the Mubarak regime and are disinterested in change and anarchy . \nUnfortunately , they are also vulnerable to conspiracy theories . \nWhat the media is not telling you ? \nInherent problems of the Arab world : - Dreaming to impose Islam worldwide by force - All the ME regimes and religious leaders brain washed peoples mind against external imaginary enemies - Investing in armies but not in future building - Increasing prices of basic food . \n- Inability to compete in the modern world No political movement calls to deal with the infrastructure issues ; Lessen to ME people and political declarations it is obvious that : The Arab masses want a solution to the unemployment and food problems regardless the regime type . \nFebruary 1st , 2011 5:40 pm ET It is interesting that according to many media and commentators above , all of a sudden , millions of people around the world now agree with Avigdor Lieberman . \nWill that send them running in the other direction ?! February 2nd , 2011 12:35 am ET Several aspects need to be considered by the US and any other government , as well as anybody expressing opinions or support to Egypt : 1 . \nIf you were in President Mubarak 's shoes , you would be scared . \nHe fears for his life and unless a safe exit is guaranteed for him , preferably by another country , he will have difficulty acknowledging that he needs to step down immediately , for the sake of his own people . \nThe world should not offer `` half-ass '' support and deals , as this will only breed resentment and lead to violence and a militant theocracy taking over . \nPresident Obama 's speech this evening is an example of such deal . \nThink : if you were an Egyptian putting your life on the line out in the streets , what impact would his message have on you ? \nEgyptian people need help handling the protests and the post-protest times . \nThey have not had the privilege of growing up in a free society and being privy to peaceful and collaborative tools of resolving conflict . \nWhat is going on with this world ??? what about pease ? \nFebruary 2nd , 2011 5:47 pm ET I plead all the European leaders and USA to force Mubarak to resign before the massacre among the protesters . \nFebruary 3rd , 2011 1:01 pm ET noo plz not by this way if Mubarak to resign now egypt will be destroyed the people who protesters now in ELTAHRER dont representing Egyptians I plead all the European leaders and USA to ASK EGYPTIONS OUTSIDE -LRB- ELTAHER -RRB- before take any decision How about this amazing policy statement from the Quran ? \n`` He will teach him the scripture , wisdom , the Torah , and certain prohibitions imposed upon you . \nI come to you with sufficient proof from your Lord . \nTherefore , you shall observe GOD , and obey me . \nO followers of the scripture , why do you argue about Abraham , when the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him ? \nDo you not understand ? '' \nThat 's how we in the US can help democratize the entire Middle East . \nWonder how that would sound in Hebrew , Koine Greek , even Latin which were all political before the writing of the Quran . \nIs n't this the highest form of freedom of speech there is ? \ni am Egyptian . . \nand now i proud February 6th , 2011 5:47 am ET Those who start protesting in Tahrir square are the young generation . \nIt is true that many of opposition Parties try to ride the wave . \nBut , they will not succeed as they never represented the people . \nAs for the Muslim Brotherhood they are not welcomed by the people at all , even from religious Muslims . \nThere numbers are not as the west think . \nThey are not welcomed by anyone and will never take over Egypt . \nAs for Mubarak he is trying to gain back his power over the country . \nHe might succeed as the changes that he made are fake and all the new faces are in fact supporters to his regime . \nWe need really the changes we claim , but the result is not clear at all ! \nFebruary 8th , 2011 1:56 pm ET Learn , think and watch your steps ! \nThe free world is advised to learn the lesson of `` Tehran 1979 , '' when a pro-Western dictator , the Shah , was overthrown by an alliance of reformists and Islamists . \nShortly after the fall of the Shah , the Islamists smashed the reformists , establishing an anti-Western regime that sponsored anti liberal and democratic values using terrorism and radicalism throughout the world . \nThe demonstrations in Tunisia and Egypt undermined the foundations of much of Obama 's approach to the Middle East . \nObama administration Middle East policy is lead by the motto `` anything but Bush . '' \nIt castigates Bush for being unrealistic regarding the promotion of democracy in the Arab world . \nBush 's support for democratization led not to democracy but to the rise of Hamas Islamic terrorists - a branch of Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza . \nNow Obama is repeating Bush 's mistake in Egypt the leading strategic country in the Arab world . \nObama calls for the inclusion of `` non-secular '' groups in the new government . \nIslamists anti-Western values and democratic government is deeply ideological and is not related to any American policy . \nObama willingness to abandon USA allies and embrace the Islamists will harm the standing of USA allies and strengthen anti-Western Islamists across the region Comments are moderated by CNN , in accordance with the CNN Comment Policy , and may not appear on this blog until they have been reviewed and deemed appropriate for posting . \nAlso , due to the volume of comments we receive , not all comments will be posted . \nWelcome to the Inside the Middle East blog where CNN 's journalists post news , views and video from across the region . \nThis is also a place where you can start the discussion so please keep your comments coming . \nWe highlight not only current news stories but also anecdotes and issues that do n't always make the top of the headlines . \nInside the Middle East airs the first week of every month on the following days and times :",

        "text": "Bad weather halted some clean-up efforts from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on Tuesday as high winds and waves from a strengthening storm threatened to hamper plans to capture more of the crude gushing from the largest spill in U.S. history . \nThe National Hurricane Center said tropical storm Alex would build into the first hurricane of the Atlantic season as it moved over southern Gulf waters . \nRipple effects from Alex produced six-foot -LRB- 1.8-meter -RRB- waves and wind gusts of up to 20 miles per hour and were expected to last a couple of days , said Phil Grigsby of the National Weather Service in New Orleans . \nOffshore oil clean-up activity off the Louisiana coast was halted because of severe weather , the U.S. Coast Guard said . \nControlled burns of oil on the ocean , flights spraying dispersant chemicals and booming operations were all stopped , said Coast Guard Petty Officer Kelly Parker . \nHowever , BP Plc 's oil-capture and relief well drilling continued at the site of the leak . \nGrigsby said the weather would also affect clean-up operations on beaches and marshes . \nAlex , forecast to strengthen into a hurricane later on Tuesday , was churning northwest across the southwestern Gulf and expected to come ashore near the Texas-Mexico border late Wednesday or early Thursday . \nBP spokesman Robert Wine said BP 's oil-capture and relief well drilling operations were continuing . \n`` That 's all big equipment , and it is n't as affected by the sea state , '' he said of three rigs and a drillship a mile above the leak . \nBP officials have said waves as high as 12 feet -LRB- 4 metros -RRB- would delay plans to hook up a third system to capture much more oil and officials in Florida said high surf would probably hamper clean-up efforts . \nBP 's market capitalization has shrunk by $ 100 billion since its Deepwater Horizon drilling rig sank in 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,525 metros -RRB- of water on April 22 , two days after an explosion and fire killed 11 workers . \nBut U.S.-listed shares of BP closed 2.29 percent higher at $ 27.67 on Tuesday on bargain-hunting . \nThe shares have lost more than half their value since the spill began . \n`` It 's tough to say if the stock has bottomed because the political situation remains so fluid , but on a basis the stock is attractive , '' said John Brady , senior vice president at MF Global in Chicago . \nThe stock 's weakness since the disaster has also sparked talk of a possible takeover bid . \n`` The spill is bad , but you need to remember that BP is a global company with a global business , and there 's strength elsewhere , '' Brady said . \nThe oil spill crisis is in its 71st day with no firm end in sight . \nThe economic and ecological costs to tourism , wildlife , fishing and other industries , already massive , continue to mount for four states along the U.S. Gulf coast . \nThe lucrative tourism industry in the Gulf could be hard hit for years by a false perception the spill has ruined all the beaches , tourism officials said . \nU.S. government officials estimate 35,000 to 60,000 barrels are gushing from the blown-out well each day . \nBP 's containment system can handle up to 28,000 barrels daily . \nThe planned addition would have raised that to 53,000 bpd . \nSenior U.S. officials were beating a path to the Gulf region , responding to criticism that President Barack Obama and his administration responded too slowly to the crisis . \nTuesday 's visitors included Vice President Joe Biden . \nA U.S. appeals court set July 8 for oral arguments on the Obama administration 's request to stay a ruling that lifted its six-month moratorium on deepwater oil drilling . \nA federal judge blocked it at the request of drilling companies , saying the suspension was too broad and arbitrary . \nPolls have given Obama low marks for his handling of the disaster , although not as low as those given to BP . \n`` BP 's handling of the spill from a crisis management perspective will go down in history as one of the great examples of how to make a situation worse by bad communications , '' said Michael Gordon , of New York-based crisis PR firm Group Gordon Strategic Communications . \nMistakes include downplaying the environmental damage , initially blaming others for the disaster and underestimating the amount of oil leaking , analysts say . \nAs crude oil and dispersants float on the surface of the Gulf , crews are battling to keep it off beaches and away from wildlife breeding grounds . \nOn Louisiana 's Bay Baptiste , winds whipped waves up about a foot high and white caps were visible in the distance as the outer bands of Alex began to move into the region . \nSeveral marshes were only partially boom-protected , with oil coating the bottom part of reeds as crabs covered in crude scurried on nearby marsh islands . \nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30 and meteorologists predict this year will be very active , suggesting more problems for the oil spill clean-up effort . \nIn Biloxi , Mississippi , BP spokesman Richard Judy acknowledged problems with clean-up operations after the state 's mainland was hit by oil . \n`` What 's keeping us busy in this area is maintaining boom , in some cases putting out new boom , doing pick-up of oiled material on the beaches when it gets there and also going out and working on the coastal islands , '' Judy said . \n`` Weather has been a problem . \nWe have to be careful not to keep our crews on beaches if there 's lightning nearby . '' \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nContainment and closure would have been better but then the loss of profits by the top 2 % would have been unbearable . \nSo , in keeping with the agenda of having the general population eat the garbage left by those who are presumed better human beings , we 'll just say `` how unfortunate that the hurrican season has n't been postponed . '' \nThis is yellow journalism at its best . \nIf there was n't an oil spill in the Gulf , nobody north of Brownsville would take a second look at Alex or any overzealous newscaster 's warning of `` coastal flooding '' on the north side or water churning in the Gulf . \nAs a native southeast Texan , I 've been through my share of hurricanes and tropical storms , and I can safely say that I am not the least bit worried about Alex , `` coastal flooding '' north of South Padre Island or any effect that it `` might '' have on the BP oil spill . \nYou just focus on getting that relief well drilled , BP , and those claims dispersed to the people who need them . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform",

        "text": "Chief executives of public bodies should be forced to justify their salary and have pay docked if they do n't perform , a government-sponsored report recommended on Tuesday . \nThe findings of the `` Fair Pay Review '' are designed to halt a decade-long trend which has seen pay at the top of the public sector grow faster than pay levels at the bottom . \nPrime Minister David Cameron asked Will Hutton , a left-leaning commentator and former head of the Work Foundation , to conduct the review last year . \nScrutiny of high-earning executives has intensified ever since the government was forced to bail out the banking sector with public funds . \nMost public anger has been directed at bank chief executives , labeled `` fat cats '' in the media , but top-earning public sector chiefs have not been immune . \nIn an interim report last December , Hutton set out a case for a maximum pay multiple that would keep the pay of top executives bound to what their staff earned , with a 20:1 ratio the maximum . \nIn Tuesday 's final report , Hutton moves away from this idea . \nInstead he proposes that public sector executives place at least 10 percent of their salary at risk in an `` earnback '' scheme , which can only be reclaimed if targets are met . \nIf targets are exceeded , the same proportion could be earned as a bonus . \n`` I am recommending that all public service executives are required to place an element of their basic pay at risk , to be earned back each year through good performance , '' Hutton said . \nThe report also recommends that public bodies publish , and justify , the multiple of chief executive to workforce median pay -- a step it argues should also be adopted by the private sector . \n`` Organisations delivering public services should publish their pay multiples each year , and disclose and explain executive pay and how it relates to job responsibilities and individual performance , '' Hutton said . \nThe government , eager for a framework to curb what Hutton has called an `` arms race '' - like scramble to increase remuneration for high-earners , is likely to welcome the recommendations . \nBut Unison , Britain 's largest trade union , said the review did not go far enough . \n`` The focus on top pay is a missed opportunity . \nTo really boost fairness in the public sector , and our society as a whole , we need to tackle low wages -- not just income inequality , '' Unison General Secretary Dave Prentis said . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform",

        "text": "Senior Syrian army ranks are packed with loyal members of President Bashar al-Assad 's Alawite minority , reducing any prospect of military pressure on him to stand aside if protests grow , military experts say . \nUnlike the armies in Tunisia and Egypt , whose refusal to confront non-violent demonstrations spelt the demise of their autocratic rulers , the fate of many senior Syrian military officers is closely tied to that of Assad . \nAlthough some officers from the Sunni Muslim majority have been promoted to senior ranks , Sunni influence has been weakened and Assad 's brother Maher controls key military units packed with Alawite soldiers . \n`` It will take an extraordinary amount of people power to defeat a regime this deeply entrenched . \nThis is not Tunisia , '' said W. Andrew Terrill , research professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Army War college . \n`` The regime has been careful about placing Alawite loyalists in all key positions within the military so that the regime can defeat any effort to overthrow it . \nSome Sunni officers have risen to very high ranks but have very little power to command troops , '' Terrill said from Carlisle Barracks , Pennsylvania . \nThe Assad family which has ruled Syria for 41 years comes from the Alawite mountains overlooking the Mediterranean , a stronghold of the secretive sect with links to Shi'ite Islam . \nAssad , who faces the greatest threat to his rule from more than two weeks of protests calling for an end to emergency law and one-party rule , has responded with a blend of force -- his security forces have killed dozens of protesters -- and vague promises of reform . \nResidents of Deraa , cradle of the Syrian protests , say Alawite forces commanded by Assad 's younger brother Maher have taken up positions around the southern city . \nMaher controls the Presidential Guard , the Republican Guard , and the Fourth Armoured Division -- key units that form the security backbone of the state together with the Alawite-dominated secret police . \n`` Some observers consider Maher al-Assad to be excessively violent and emotionally volatile . \nIt appears that President Assad views his brother as totally trustworthy , '' said Terrill , a specialist in Syrian military affairs . \nAlthough family ties ensure the loyalty of the top brass , Assad can not antagonize the army rank-and-file with a repeat of the 1982 crackdown on the city of Hama , when his father Hafez al-Assad sent commandos , paratroopers and Baath Party irregulars to put down an armed uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood . \nHafez al-Assad 's brother Rifaat personally managed the Hama operation , in which tens of thousands were killed and parts of the city flattened . \n`` Syria 2011 is not Syria 1982 . \nYou have hundreds of thousands of soldiers -- conscripts and professional soldiers -- who have seen only corruption and abuse of position by their Alawite commanders , '' said a former Syrian army member . \n`` It will be very dangerous for Bashar to play this game . \n`` The army will not ask Bashar to step down , as was the case in Egypt and Tunisia , but he can not easily ask the army to commit massacres either , '' the ex-soldier said . \nAssad would also be hesitant to use Maher 's Republican Guard to quell protest because it would increase resentment against Alawites , he said . . \nAnother military expert working for a Western government said the Syrian army would fracture if the Alawite ruling hierarchy attempted a repeat of the Hama massacre , but the president could get away with smaller scale killings . \n`` It would also depend on how the killings are presented . \nThere is a difference between shooting peaceful protesters and killing demonstrators who attack security forces , '' he said . \nAlthough Deraa residents say Maher al-Assad 's units are positioned around the city , Alawite secret police and special police units have deployed to confront demonstrators . \nMore than 40 protesters have been killed in the clashes , witnesses said . \nTerrill said Alawite units would have no qualms suppressing dissent because they have been indoctrinated to believe their community would lose out if majority Sunnis attain power . \n`` It can be safely assumed that virtually all of the Alawites within the military will fight to defend the regime . '' \nAsked if Sunni soldiers could revolt if they saw more of their co-religionists killed , Terrill said : `` Syria 's security organs will move quickly and ruthlessly to suppress even the germs of revolt within the military .

        "text": "By the CNN Wire Staff NEW : Rebel official complains of lack of NATO air support British foreign secretary says his country wo n't arm rebels Rebel forces say they have al-Brega surrounded Greek foreign minister : `` It is clear that the -LRB- Libyan -RRB- administration is looking for a solution '' Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan rebels and forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi fought over the cities of al-Brega and Misrata on Monday , as uncertainty lingered whether Western nations would arm the outgunned opposition . \nAn opposition officer in al-Brega said Monday that rebel forces had the oil town surrounded from the north , east and west and had been bombarding the area with rockets for much of the afternoon . \n \n`` We have surrounded al-Brega from the north , east and west , '' he said unnamed . \nNew al-Brega , a suburban area of the homes of workers at a nearby oil refinery , was partially under rebel control . \nOpposition officers said they were still clearing the area of Gadhafi forces , and a resident fleeing the area told CNN that it is still unsafe . \nThere have been no NATO airstrikes in the area for at least 24 hours , he said . \nThe perceived lack of airstrikes enforcing a U.N. resolution to protect civilians from Gadhafi 's forces and enforce an arms embargo brought criticism from a rebel spokesman on Monday . \n`` You are supposed to be implementing this resolution and clearly it 's not implemented in Misrata , it 's not implemented in Zintan or Zahwiya , and we 're wondering where are they ? '' \nIn Misrata , destruction permeated the city , which has been choked off by pro-Gadhafi forces . \nRebels , Gadhafi forces clash in oil town Wounded treated on hospital ship The battle for medical aid in Libya How Libyan government treats media An opposition councilman in Misrata told CNN that a tank entered the outskirts of the city about 3 a.m. Monday and headed for the port area . \nOpposition fighters descended on the area and fought for two hours to force the tank to turn back , which it eventually did , the councilman said . \nThe councilman said he could hear NATO jets flying overhead Monday afternoon for the first time in 36 hours . \n`` We need a lot of help in Misrata . \nThere 's so much death there , '' said Mustafa Abdul Hamali , a 46-year-old taxi driver who lost half a leg . \n`` I was driving in my car with my wife , and my car just blew up . \nI do n't know what happened . '' \nOn Monday , British Foreign Secretary William Hague ruled out his country from arming the rebels but said it would provide them telecommunications equipment , given the urgent need on the ground . \n`` We are prepared to supply nonlethal equipment which will help with the protection of civilian lives and the delivery of humanitarian aid , '' he said . \nLibyan rebels have been hampered by a lack of organization and training on heavy weaponry when confronting the better-trained , better-armed forces of Gadhafi , who is under investigation for alleged crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court . \n`` We were fighting with light weapons , but they had so much more , '' said Khalid Moteridi , 32 , a businessman who was fighting with the rebels when , he said , he was shot twice in the legs by a sniper . \n`` Artillery , mortars , rocket-propelled grenades , anti-tank rockets -- that 's how they were fighting back . '' \nWhile Hague 's statement seemed to rule out the United Kingdom from arming the rebels , U.S. officials have yet to say whether they will do so . \nBoth countries participated in airstrikes to weaken Gadhafi 's military resources before NATO officially took command of the international operation . \nDue to poor weather conditions in recent days , the United States approved a request by NATO to extend the use of some U.S. strike aircraft , NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said Sunday . \n`` This is a short-term extension , which expires on Monday , '' Lungescu said . \nMoteridi said the situation in Misrata has turned dire . \n`` It 's a tragedy by all means , '' he said . \n`` No electricity , no food , no water . \nWe 're trapped from all sides by the Gadhafi forces . '' \nA doctor in Misrata told CNN that government forces shelled a clinic , leaving one dead and 15 injured Sunday . \nLast week , a hospital official said 398 people have been killed since the Libyan conflict began last month . \nHe feared there were more deaths that his hospital did n't know about . \nDiplomatic efforts to end the crisis seemed no closer to success Monday . \nItalian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini on Monday said proposals outlined by an envoy whom Gadhafi sent to Greece were `` not credible '' and said his country would become the third to recognize the rebel Libyan National Transitional Council as the legitimate international representative of Libya . \nFrance and Qatar previously granted the rebel council similar status . \nThe nature of the message delivered by Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi was not immediately known . \n`` From what the Libyan envoy said , it is clear that the administration is looking for a solution , '' Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas said after the meeting . \nHe said Obeidi is expected to continue talks in Turkey and Malta . \nSome rebels from Misrata got a bit of a reprieve Sunday when a Turkish hospital ship picked up more than 300 of the wounded fighters . \nTheir injuries included amputated limbs , broken bones and shrapnel wounds . \nThe ship is destined for the Turkish port of Cesme , where the patients will receive medical attention , opposition officials said . \nIt made a stop in the rebel capital of Benghazi to pick up more patients and supplies , and was greeted by cheering supporters of the opposition . \nMen wearing head bandages and eye patches waved back at the crowd . \nWest of Benghazi , the tug-of-war for control continued in al-Brega , which has changed hands six times in six weeks between government and opposition forces . \nRebel fighters retreated east of al-Brega on Sunday , reporting an ambush , roadside mines and a need for more ammunition . \nOver the weekend , opposition spokesmen said 13 rebels were killed when NATO airstrikes hit several vehicles . \n`` Based on the information we have , they -LRB- the opposition forces who were hit -RRB- heard the airstrikes and went ahead to see what the damage was , and that 's when they got hit , '' rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said . \n`` They were told to stay back , but they jumped the gun . '' \nLungescu , the NATO spokeswoman , said Saturday that NATO was investigating the incident . \n`` NATO takes any reports of civilian casualties very seriously , but exact details are hard to verify , as we have no reliable sources on the ground , '' she said . \nDespite the unyielding conflict , Moteridi , the rebel fighter who was shot twice in the legs by a sniper , said he wo n't give up . \n`` I 'll go back to Misrata when I get better , God willing , and ... Gadhafi and his gangs will be defeated . '' \nCNN 's Reza Sayah , Ben Wedeman , Nic Robertson and Eve Bower and journalists Houda Zaghdoudi and Elinda Labropoulou contributed to this report",

        "text": "Wednesday , February 18 , 2009 ; 10:18 AM The deep contraction in the economy and in the housing market has created devastating consequences for homeowners and communities throughout the country . \nMillions of responsibleized homeowners have seen their mortgage payments rise to 40 or even 50 percent of their monthly income . \nMillions of workers have lost their jobs or had their hours cut back , are now struggling to stay current on their mortgage payments with nearly 6 million households facing possible foreclosure . \nNeighborhoods are struggling , as each foreclosed home reduces nearby property values by as much as 9 percent . \nThe Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan is part of the President 's broad , comprehensive strategy to get the economy back on track . \nThe plan will help up to 7 to 9 million families restructure or refinance their mortgages to avoid foreclosure . \nIn doing so , the plan not only helps responsible homeowners on the verge of defaulting , but prevents neighborhoods and communities from being pulled over the edge too , as defaults and foreclosures contribute to falling home values , failing local businesses , and lost jobs . \nThe key components of the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan are : 1 . \nAffordability : Provide Access to Low-Cost Refinancing for Responsible Homeowners Suffering From Falling Home Prices Enabling Up to 4 to 5 Million Responsible Homeowners to Refinance : Mortgage rates are currently at historically low levels , providing homeowners with the opportunity to reduce their monthly payments by refinancing . \nBut under current rules , most families who owe more than 80 percent of the value of their homes have a difficult time refinancing . \nYet millions of responsible homeowners who put money down and made their mortgage payments on time have -- through no fault of their own -- seen the value of their homes drop low enough to make them unable to access these lower rates . \nAs a result , the Obama Administration is announcing a new program that will help as many as 4 to 5 million responsible homeowners who took out conforming loans owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to refinance through those two institutions . \nReducing Monthly Payments : For many families , a low-cost refinancing could reduce mortgage payments by thousands of dollars per year : Consider a family that took out a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of $ 207,000 with an interest rate of 6.50 % on a house worth $ 260,000 at the time . \nToday , that family has about $ 200,000 remaining on their mortgage , but the value of that home has fallen 15 percent to $ 221,000 -- making them ineligible for today 's low interest rates that now generally require the borrower to have 20 percent home equity . \nUnder this refinancing plan , that family could refinance to a rate near 5.16 % -- reducing their annual payments by over $ 2,300 . \nStability : Create A $ 75 Billion Homeowner Stability Initiative to Reach Up to 3 to 4 Million At-Risk Homeowners Helping Hard-Pressed Homeowners Stay in their Homes : This initiative is intended to reach millions of responsible homeowners who are struggling to afford their mortgage payments because of the current recession , yet can not sell their homes because prices have fallen so significantly . \nMillions of hard-working families have seen their mortgage payments rise to 40 or even 50 percent of their monthly income -- particularly those who received subprime and exotic loans with exploding terms and hidden fees . \nThe Homeowner Stability Initiative helps those who commit to make reasonable monthly mortgage payments to stay in their homes -- providing families with security and neighborhoods with stability . \nNo Aid for Speculators : This initiative will go solely to helping homeowners who commit to make payments to stay in their home it will not aid speculators or house flippers .",

'' \nIn the nine days since the start of the Western-led bombing , the motley volunteer force of rebels has pressed half-way along the coast from its stronghold of Benghazi towards the capital Tripoli and regained control of most major oil terminals in the OPEC member state . \nA U.S. Treasury Department official said the rebels could sell Libyan crude without being subject to U.S. sanctions if they conducted the transactions outside the National Oil Corporation and other entities in Gaddafi 's administration subject to sanctions . \nWith its finances under pressure , the rebel leadership said it hopes to restart oil exports within a week . \nSome energy traders said that , sanctions aside , they could not touch Libyan oil because of shipping and legal risks . \nOn Monday the rebels met sporadic resistance as they continued their advance in convoys of pick-up trucks with machineguns mounted on them . \nJust west of sandy , barren Nawfaliyah , bursts of sustained machinegun fire and the whoosh of several rockets could be heard , and plumes of black smoke rose ahead . \n`` Those are from our guns , '' said Faisal Bozgaia , 28 , a hospital worker turned rebel fighter , pointing to the smoke . \nRebels said occasional ambushes by Gaddafi forces had pushed them back but that they later regained their positions . \n`` We are advancing one , two kilometres at a time , '' rebel Khalif Ali , 22 , said in the town of Harawah , west of Nawfaliyah . \nBut the rapid advance is stretching rebel supply lines . \n`` We have a serious problem with petrol , '' said a volunteer fighter waiting to fill up in the oil town of Ras Lanuf . \nReuters correspondent Michael Georgy , reporting from Sirte to the west , said he saw police and military but no sign of fighting . \nSoldiers were manning checkpoints and green Libyan flags flapped in the wind . \nMilitiamen fired AK-47 rifles defiantly into the air . \n`` If they come to Sirte , we will defend our city , '' said Osama bin Nafaa , 32 , a policeman . \nIn Misrata , Gaddafi soldiers manned checkpoints and took up position on rooftops . \nSome housefronts were smashed , smoke was rising from several areas and gunfire rang out constantly across the city . \nSeveral civilians approached a group of journalists , some of them woman and children waving green flags . \n`` Civilians are happy , '' said an army official who declined to be named . \n`` Everything you are hearing is a lie . \nThe function of our army is to save the people and to protect the leader . \nWe can not kill our own people . '' \nA rebel spokesman in another western town , Zintan , said forces loyal to Gaddafi had bombarded the town with rockets early on Monday , Al Jazeera reported . \nWestern-led air strikes began on March 19 , two days after the U.N. Security Council authorised `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians from Gaddafi 's forces . \nBut from the outset , the mission has faced questions about its scope and aims , including the extent to which it will actively back the rebel side and whether it might target Gaddafi himself . \nThe start of allied bombings proved a turning point for the rebels who were hemmed into Benghazi at the time . \nRussia , which abstained in the U.N. vote , said Western attacks on Gaddafi 's forces amounted to taking sides . \n`` We consider that intervention by the coalition in what is essentially an internal civil war is not sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council resolution , '' Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a news conference . \nNATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen told the BBC : `` We are there to protect civilians -- no more , no less . '' \nFrance , which dropped the first bombs of the campaign nine days ago , said the coalition was strictly complying with U.N. terms . \nIt said its planes struck a command center south of Tripoli belonging to Gaddafi 's forces on Sunday and Monday . \nThe Defense Ministry in London said British Tornado aircraft destroyed Libyan government ammunition bunkers in the Sabha area of Libya 's southern desert in the early hours of Monday . \n`` He -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- is still capable ... of inflicting further great bloodshed on the people of his own country . \nSo we must maintain our efforts absolutely in line with international law , '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague told BBC television . \nOn Sunday , NATO agreed to take full command of military operations in Libya after a week of heated negotiations . \nThe United States , which led the initial phase , had sought to scale back its role in another Muslim country after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . \nAn alliance spokeswoman said on Monday the transition would take a couple of days . \nLibya accused NATO of `` terrorising '' and killing its people as part of a global plot to humiliate and weaken it . \nThe government says the Western-led air attacks have killed more than 100 civilians , a charge denied by the coalition which says it is protecting civilians from Gaddafi 's forces and targeting only military sites to enforce a no-fly zone .",

        "text": "Police are guarding the Hong Kong hotel where the man stayed About 300 people at a Hong Kong hotel have been placed under quarantine after a guest there became China 's first confirmed swine flu case . \nThe 25-year-old man , who is now in hospital after testing positive for the virus , had traveled from Mexico via Shanghai , Hong Kong 's leader said . \nLocal TV footage showed police wearing masks guarding the hotel exits . \nMeanwhile , the UK joined Canada , Spain , Germany and the US in reporting person-to-person transmission of the virus . \nOn Friday , French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot said two people were infected with swine flu , France 's first confirmed cases . \nShe said it was not clear whether the two had been in contact with each other or with the same infected person . \nThe announcements take to 16 the number of countries where swine flu has been confirmed . \nMexico , where the outbreak began , has shut down parts of its economy for five days in a bid to curb the virus 's progress . \nLate on Friday , Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova announced the confirmed death toll from the virus had risen by one , to 16 . \n`` The mortality rate is n't as great as could be expected , '' said Mr Cordova . \n`` The majority of the deaths are women . '' \nMexican officials say the spread of swine flu - suspected in more than 380 deaths - is slowing . \nInternational experts are more cautious - but one , Nancy Cox , chief of America 's Center for Disease Control 's influenza division , said the new virus lacked the traits that made the 1918 pandemic so deadly . \n`` We do not see the markers for virulence that were seen in the 1918 virus , '' she said . \nIn cases outside Mexico the effects of the virus do not appear to be severe , although one death of a Mexican child has been confirmed in the US . \nThe WHO has set its pandemic alert level at five - but says it has no immediate plans to move to the highest level of six . \nIn Hong Kong , the authorities have raised the alert level to emergency but urged residents to carry on life as normal . \nUS : One death , at least 141 confirmed cases New Zealand : 4 confirmed , 12 probable cases The Netherlands , Switzerland , Austria , Denmark , Hong Kong , South Korea : 1 confirmed case each Countries with confirmed cases of secondary transmission `` I stress we do n't need to panic . '' \nThe Mexican man is said to be in a stable condition in Hong Kong 's Princess Margaret Hospital , after seeking treatment on Thursday night after becoming unwell . \nThe Metropark Hotel in Wanchai district where he briefly stayed will be sealed off for seven days , health officials said , and the antiviral drug Tamiflu given to about 200 guests and 100 staff there . \nMedical staff wearing protective clothing were seen carrying boxes of equipment into the building . \nEfforts are also under way to trace people who traveled on the same flights as the Mexican , and taxi drivers with whom he came into contact . \nBBC China Editor Shirong Chen says confirmation that the man has tested positive for the virus has set alarm bells ringing beyond Hong Kong . \nChinese Health Minister Chen Zhu said the virus was very likely to enter mainland China and urged the country to prepare for an outbreak , as millions start traveling over the May Day long weekend . \nIn South Korea , a 51-year-old woman who had recently returned from Mexico was confirmed as the country 's first case , Yonhap news agency reported . \nTwo other people are being tested for the virus , the agency said . \nMeanwhile , the authorities in Mexico hope a nationwide shut-down ordered from Friday , covering two public holidays and a weekend , will help curb the spread of the virus . \nSYMPTOMS - WHAT TO DO Swine flu symptoms are similar to those produced by ordinary seasonal flu - fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue If you have flu symptoms and recently visited affected areas of Mexico , you should seek medical advice If you suspect you are infected , you should stay at home and take advice by telephone initially , in order to minimize the risk of infection Some factories will stop production and schools are already closed . \nResidents have been urged to stay at home , but it is not clear how widely the shut-down order will be followed . \nThe number of confirmed cases of swine flu infection in Mexico now stands at more than 300 , officials say . \nMexican Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova said on Friday that three more deaths from swine flu had been confirmed , bringing the toll to 15 . \nAnnouncing the figure , Mr Cordova said that new cases of the virus were levelling off . \nBut Dr Keiji Fukuda , acting assistant director general of the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- , said fluctuations were to be expected . \nThe US announces that it will buy 13 million new courses of antiviral treatment and send 400,000 of them to Mexico A flight from Germany to Washington DC is diverted to Boston after a female passenger complains of flu-like symptoms An aide to US Energy Secretary Stephen Chu who helped arrange President Barack Obama 's recent trip to Mexico is being tested for swine flu , although the aide is said not to have been in contact with the president The head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is fine for people without flu symptoms to fly and use the subway , a day after Vice-President Joe Biden said he would advise his own family members against using public transport Denmark reports its first confirmed case of swine flu German authorities confirm that a nurse who treated a patient with swine flu also contracted the disease , in the first person-to-person transmission in the country Test results confirm the UK 's first person-to-person transmission of swine flu , in a friend of a couple from Scotland who were first in the country to be diagnosed with the virus Several countries have restricted travel to Mexico and many tour operators have canceled holidays . \nThe WHO , meanwhile , says it will now call the virus influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- rather than swine flu - which it says is misleading as pork meat is safe and the virus is being transmitted from human to human . \nAre you in the hotel in Hong Kong ? \nHave you been affected by swine flu ? \nYou can send us your experiences using the form below : A selection of your comments may be published , displaying your name and location unless you state otherwise in the box below . \nThe BBC may edit your comments and not all emails will be published . \nYour comments may be published on any BBC media worldwide .",

        "text": "May 28 : BP CEO Tony Hayward speaks during recovery operations at the Deepwater Horizon oil spill site in the Gulf . \nAP BP appears to have had enough of its embattled CEO , and are sending him to the Russian front -- literally . \nThe oil giant 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , will step down from BP 's top post in October and take a job with TNK-BP , the company 's joint venture in Russia , Sky News reported Monday . \nHayward , who became the face of BP 's flailing efforts to contain the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and clean up millions in damages , will likely be replaced by BP managing director Robert Dudley . \nBP said earlier Monday that `` no final decision '' had been made about management changes , which reportedly include the departure of Hayward as chief executive in an effort to mend the company 's image after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . \nThe oil company said its board would meet Monday evening , a day before it announces earnings for the second quarter . \nThe BP board would have to approve a change in company leadership . \n`` BP notes the press speculation over the weekend regarding potential changes to management and the charge for the costs of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . \nBP confirms that no final decision has been made on these matters , '' the company said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange . \nThe Obama administration has called on the company to meet its clean-up obligations , despite changes in management . \n`` BP can not , should not and will not leave the Gulf without meeting its responsibilities to plug the well , to clean up the damage that 's been caused and to compensate those that have been damaged . \nI think that is the most important lesson out of here , '' White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters . \n`` Regardless of who leads the company , those obligations and responsibilities must be met , '' he said . \nHayward , 53 , had become a lightning rod for outrage in the United States about the spill , which started on April 20 with an explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon rig . \nEleven workers died in the disaster . \nHayward 's comment that he was eager to resolve the incident `` so that I can have my life back '' antagonized his critics in the United States . \nDudley , currently heading the effort to clean up the Gulf Coast , figured prominently in speculation about Hayward 's likely successor . \nDudley is currently BP 's managing director , and grew up partly in Hattiesburg , Mississippi . \nHe spent 20 years at Amoco Corp. , which merged with BP in 1998 , and lost out to Hayward on the CEO 's slot three years ago . \nHe took over from Hayward as the point man on the cleanup in June . \nLast week , BP said the cost of dealing with the spill had reached nearly $ 4 billion , but that it was too early to quantify the eventual total cost . \nHayward joined BP in 1982 as a geologist , and currently makes 1.045 million pounds -LRB- US$ 1.6 million -RRB- a year as the company 's head , according to its annual report . \nIn 2009 , he received a performance bonus of more than 2 million pounds plus other remuneration , bringing his total pay package to more than 4 million pounds . \nBP is in the process of selling assets to raise $ 10 billion toward a $ 20 billion fund that will finance the cleanup of the mess in the Gulf . \nBP announced last week that it had sold properties in the United States , Canada and Egypt to Apache Corp. for $ 7 billion . \nUnder pressure from President Obama , BP also has announced that it will pay no more dividends to shareholders this year . \nThe Associated Press and Newscore contributed to this report Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com .",

        "text": "cents Freeze on drilling has put thousands out of work cents Giant oil tanker sent out to boost collection capacity The site of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nPhotograph : Jae C. Hong\\/AP The political and financial pressure on BP escalated sharply yesterday as the US government demanded compensation for thousands of oil industry workers laid off as a result of a freeze on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe company 's share price fell by more than 9 % on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , wiping $ 1.7 bn off the value of the company since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster . \nIn an unexpected addition to BP 's already huge liabilities from America 's worst ever oil spill , the White House said it would press the company to pay the salaries of staff laid off as a result of a six-month moratorium imposed by the Obama administration on exploration activity in the Gulf . \nThe freeze means a halt to work on 33 existing oil rigs , affecting thousands of jobs . \nThe warning , together with fears that the gush of oil in the gulf could be even worse than estimated , sent BP 's American shares down 15.8 % in a late fall on the New York Stock Exchange , pushing them to their lowest level since 1996 . \nThis was despite hopeful news from BP 's operation to plug the undersea leak as it was revealed that the company collected 15,000 barrels of oil on Tuesday . \nAs many as 15 Congressional committees are investigating the oil spill and at one of many hearings yesterday , the US interior secretary , Ken Salazar , said he would ask BP to repay the salaries of workers laid off by the moratorium on drilling . \nThe White House press secretary Robert Gibbs later went further , saying the freeze is `` a result of the accident that BP caused '' . \nHe added : `` It is an economic loss for those workers and those are claims that BP should pay . \nWe believe it 's an economic damage caused by this , not unlike losing business at your bait and tackle shop . '' \nThere were signs last night that BP was heading for a showdown with the administration over the issue . \nA BP source told Reuters that `` at some point a line has to be drawn '' . \nAs it struggles to stem the oil gushing from its ruptured undersea well , BP has dispatched a giant oil tanker , the Loch Rannoch , from its North Sea operations off the Shetland Islands to the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe ship will help to increase the capacity to collect oil from 18,000 barrels per day to 28,000 a capability which , if required in full , would exceed the US government 's top estimates of the scope of the spill , which range from 19,000 to 25,000 barrels per day . \n`` We continue to make progress , '' said Thad Allen , the US coastguard admiral overseeing the operation . \n`` I 'm not going to declare victory on anything until I have absolute numbers . '' \nEarlier , Allen had shown impatience with BP 's handling of compensation claims from shrimpers , fishermen , property owners and tourism workers . \nTo date , BP has made interim payments of $ 5,000 to many of those lodging claims which has been dismissed as inadequate by victims ' lawyers . \nIn a letter to BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward , Allen said : `` We need more detail and openness from BP to fulfil our oversight responsibilities to the American people and ensure that you are meeting your commitment to restore the gulf coast . '' \nIn Washington , political scrutiny on the oil company is increasing . \nNancy Pelosi , speaker of the House of Representatives , has met with chairmen of seven committees to co-ordinate a fight with so-called `` big oil '' . \nShe pledged legislation by August to address the causes and consequences of the Deepwater Horizon disaster , which began when a BP oil rig caught fire and sank on 20 April , killing 11 workers . \nAnger boiled over at one hearing as a Texan shrimper , Diane Wilson , interrupted evidence by interior secretary Ken Salazar to a senate committee by walking to the center of the room and pouring a beaker of amber-coloured oil over her hair , face and body to protest at the possibility of a cap on BP 's liability . \nShe told senators : `` With this BP disaster , I am seeing the destruction of my community and I am outraged . '' \nThe dive in BP 's shares on Wall Street raises the prospect of a fresh slump when London Stock Exchange opens this morning . \nBP 's stock has already fallen by 40 % since the explosion . \nThe firm is under pressure from the Obama administration to halt dividend payouts to investors . \nEach of the rigs affected by a freeze on drilling employs between 180 and 280 workers . \nBut the International Association of Drilling Contractors maintains that as many as 46,000 jobs depend on these deepsea drilling operations .",

'' \nLater , Mr Mulet told the BBC that all of Haiti 's recent development had been undone . \n`` I think this is going to take many more decades than only 10 years and this is an enormous backwards step in Haiti 's development . \nWe will not have to start from zero but from below zero , '' he said . \nThe UN 's assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping operations , who is acting head of mission in Haiti , described the logistics of the relief operation as a `` nightmare '' , but said those involved were still managing to improve their capacity to provide the help needed . \n`` All this is coming together right now , '' he said . \n`` Every day you can see more and more Haitian national police on the ground , working with our troops and more and more water being distributed , so it 's a matter of time and putting all these elements together . '' \nHe said areas around Port-au-Prince were being prepared for the creation of tented settlements for the homeless currently living in makeshift camps . \nEdmond Mulet said all of Haiti 's recent development had been undone The Inter-American Development Bank -LRB- IDB -RRB- was working with UN and Brazilian engineers at one site near Croix-des-Bouquets that would house around 30,000 people , and four other sites had been identified , he added . \nMr Mulet said 200,000 heavy-duty tents had been ordered to cope with Haiti 's rainy season , which typically begins in May , and its hurricane season , which is expected to start around June . \n`` Of course , 200,000 family-sized tents - solid ones that can withstand a hurricane season - are not available in the market just like that , so they have to be made . \nIt 's going to take a few days and weeks before they can arrive , but all this is coming , '' he added . \nHaitian President Rene Preval earlier this week called for the urgent airdrop of 200,000 more tents and 26 million ready-to-eat meals before the rainy season begins . \nSky News Haiti Quake Survivors Face Threat Of Disease - 2 hrs ago Melbourne Age Haiti will take decades to recover , UN warns - 4 hrs ago News24 . \ncom Disease spreads in Haiti - 6 hrs ago Guardian .",

'' \nLast week : President Ali Abdullah Saleh had said he would not seek re-election and would not pass power to his son , but it was n't enough for thousands of anti-government protesters who gathered near Sanaa University in the nation 's capital . \nThey spoke out against poverty and demanded that Saleh , whose term ends in 2013 , step down . \nSaleh said he has requested his party to freeze debate on a constitutional amendment to end term limits until a consensus is reached . \nA Facebook page dubbed `` Syrian Revolution 2011 '' attracted 15,000 friends in a week , Time magazine reported . \nLike other regimes in the region , Syria faces political alienation , economic dislocation and corruption , but because it has been the subject of international sanctions , it is beholden to no Western powers . \nThis separates Syria from places such as Egypt and Tunisia , analysts told the magazine . \nAccording to Human Rights Watch , security services have beaten and detained protesters . \nA candlelight vigil in old Damascus for the Egyptian protesters was broken up by people in civilian clothing , and police nearby failed to intervene . \nWhen one of the vigil 's organizers went to police , she was slapped and called a `` germ , '' the watchdog group said . \nLast week : After seeing unrest in the region , President Bashar al-Assad said he would push for political reforms in his own country because waiting for protests like those in Egypt and Tunisia might make it `` too late to do any reform . '' \nReform activists used Facebook to call for demonstrations in Damascus , Aleppo and other cities , but it was unclear how many people would turn out . \nBy all accounts a police state , Syria has been ruled by President Bashar al-Assad for more than 10 years . \nBefore him , his father , Hafez al-Assad ruled the country for almost three decades . \nA transitional government is overseeing sweeping changes after massive demonstrations forced out the country 's longtime president . \nInternet filters have disappeared and there is unfettered access to websites . \nJournalists are learning how to create a free press and are transforming their newspapers , radio broadcasts and television stations . \nReforms are taking place in every region of the country , and people are expressing their opinions openly in the streets , something that did n't happen under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . \nStill , small incidents disrupt daily activity . \nThe incidents are widely believed to be perpetrated by people who once worked for Ben Ali 's secret police and are aiming to destabilize the transitional government . \nLast week : The north African nation charged Ben Ali , as well as his wife and several relatives , with maintaining and exporting foreign currency illegally , carrying weapons and ammunition without licenses and inciting armed violence among Tunisians . \nWhen will the violence end ? \nExclusive with Yemeni Prime Minister Children of the Egyptian revolution Self-made billionaire as new Lebanese PM The ex-leader fled to Saudi Arabia last month after mass protests that left more than 100 people dead . \nProtests there began when demonstrators -- credited with starting the ripple effect of protests across North Africa and the Middle East -- lashed out at poor living conditions , high unemployment , government corruption and repression . \nFinal results of last month 's referendum show that the southern Sudanese voted almost 99 to 1 to split from the north , leading to what will be the world 's newest nation in July . \nAn election official said the vote was peaceful and transparent and `` not a single person showed up to appeal the results . '' \nDespite the vote 's smoothness , violence erupted on the north-south border when Sudanese soldiers loyal to Gabriel Tang , a southern Sudanese militia leader who fought in a 22-year-old civil war alongside the Khartoum government , refused to turn in their weapons . \nFifty people were killed in fighting . \nLast week : Already faced with the expected secession of its oil-rich south and charges of genocide against President Omar al-Bashir , Sudan 's government began seeing signs of unrest . \nPolice clashed with students in the capital Khartoum on Sunday as the protesters chanted , `` Tunisia , Egypt , Sudan together as one . '' \nAbout 100 students hurled rocks at police officers , who pushed them back . \nThe human rights group Amnesty International said more than 20 people still being held by police `` are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment . '' \nObservers say that if the country does n't find a suitable end to its political turmoil , it could become a battleground between Iran and Syria on one side and pro-Western forces on the other . \nAttempts to form a new government have been complicated by a U.N. tribunal probing the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri . \nThe tribunal is expected to implicate members of Hezbollah in the killing , which led the group to drop out of the government last month . \nLast week : Protests erupted in January as President Michel Suleiman appointed Najib Mikati , a Hezbollah-backed politician , as prime minister . \nHariri initially urged supporters to stage a `` day of rage '' and show restraint in protesting the appointment , but the demonstrations quickly grew ugly as gunshots were fired and his supporters burned tires and garbage containers in various cities . \nIn addition to a promise to lift a state of emergency , the government also cut taxes on sugar and cooking oil and increased the supply of wheat , Time magazine reports . \nThe moves come after weeks of protests . \nThe Algerian Press Service has reported that the government is also taking measures to bolster youth employment . \nSaad Djebbar , a London-based Algerian lawyer and political analyst , said he is skeptical . \n`` They want to produce some sort of trick that would show that reform is under way , like what Mubarak is doing in Egypt , who appears to be using all of the tricks in the book to avoid being removed , '' he said . \nLast week : Responding to unrest in the region , President Abdelaziz Bouteflika said he would lift the state of emergency in effect for nearly 20 years , according to the Algerian Press Service . \nLast month , the country 's largest opposition party called for demonstrations demanding the release of detainees and the restoration of individual and collective freedoms . \nOpponents blame the government for a spike in food prices and say the regime has failed to use Algeria 's vast energy wealth to better the lives of ordinary people . \nCNN 's Eliott C. McLaughlin , Steve Kastenbaum , Mohammed Jamjoom , Rima Maktabi , Josh Levs , Nic Robertson and Nada Husseini contributed to this report .",

        "text": "BP to cut production amid impact of Deepwater Horizon spill Analysts expect BP to pump about 3.6 m barrels of oil and gas a day this year , a tenth less than in 2009 Analysts expect BP to report $ 5bn profits for the final quarter in 2010 , on Tuesday . \nDudley is also expected to outline plans to eventually increase production by 3 % each year , but starting from a lower base . \n`` The US government is likely to agree to reduce its estimate of the size of the spill , which would cut BP fines , '' Panmure Gordon analyst Peter Hitchens told the Observer BP is expected to cut production amid the impact of the Deepwater Horizon spill . \nAnalysts expect that BP will pump about 3.6 m barrels of oil and gas a day this year , a tenth less than in 2009 , when it overtook US group Exxon Mobil to produce more than any other non-state-controlled company . \nSources close to the Environmental Protection Agency -LRB- EPA -RRB- also told the Observer that the US government is likely to agree to reduce its estimate of the size of the gulf spill , which would cut BP fines . \nWater samples from the gulf by US government scientists investigating the environmental damage caused by the spill are also understood to be showing a stronger than expected recovery in fish stocks , further limiting the damages payable by BP . \nShell fish stocks remain severely affected however . \nIn the last year , BP sold assets worth $ 20bn -LRB- # 17bn -RRB- , many of them mature oil and gas fields , partly to raise cash to pay for spill-related costs . \nThe company had also banked on new fields in the gulf to help it achieve its target , set out weeks before the spill , of increasing production by 1 % 2 % from 4 million barrels per day until 2015 . \nBut new regulations will increase the cost and time to develop them . \nAnalysts at Liberum Capital expect limited production growth after 2012 , but more in the longer term as BP focuses on big new finds and unconventional gas . \nPeter Hitchens , an analyst from stockbroker Panmure Gordon , said that Dudley could outline plans to eventually increase production by 3 % each year , but starting from a lower base . \nDudley is also expected to reassure investors that the $ 39bn provision it has made for spill-related costs will be more than enough . \nThey are forecasting that BP will report a $ 5bn profit in the final quarter of last year when it unveils annual results on Tuesday , with analysts expecting a similar figure from Shell , which also reports this week . \nBP 's profits , and the progress in selling assets , should allow Dudley to restart dividend payments to shareholders but the predicted payout of 7 cents a share would be roughly half the pre-disaster level . \nLast month BP formally challenged the official estimate of the size of the spill , made by US government scientists , of 4.9 m barrels , making it the world 's largest offshore accident . \nBP argues that scientists have miscalculated the flow rate from the Macondo well , and that the actual spill size could be half the official estimate . \nIt will also point to the number of different estimates of the flow rate made by the US government as evidence of their fallibility , and the EPA is understood to accept that no estimate can be 100 % accurate . \nBP is thought to be preparing to enter negotiations with the EPA on the issue , although it will be some months before a final estimate is agreed .",

        "text": "European Union President Criticizes Obama 's Economic Policies Members of the European Parliament vote on a package of bills . \nThe Czech prime minister 's comments about U.S. policies angered some legislators . \nSTRAIGBADDISTRIBUTION PARIS | Wed May 25 , 2009 6:55 pm EDT STRAIGBERG -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The European Union 's top leader on Wednesday attacked the U.S. government for failing to respond to the economic crisis in a speech in which he called it `` the road to hell . '' \nThe comments by Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek of the Czech Republic , which holds the E.U. 's rotating presidency , startled some U.S. and European officials , who are preparing for President Obama 's visit next month to several European cities , including Prague , the Czech capital . \nIn an address to the European Parliament in Strasbourg , France , Topolanek abandoned diplomatic niceties and blasted Washington for approving a $ 787 billion economic stimulus package , which he said encouraged `` protectionist '' trade policies . \nHe said the overall U.S. strategy for ending the recession would flood global markets with too many dollars and lead to bigger problems . \n`` All of these steps , these combinations and permanency , is the road to hell , '' Topolanek said . \n`` The United States did not take the right path . '' \nTopolanek 's critique came one day after his government was toppled by a no-confidence vote by opposition lawmakers in the Czech Parliament . \nAlthough he will remain prime minister for the time being , his shaky position at home raised questions about whether he could remain effective as the E.U. president until his country 's six-month term expires at the end of June . \n`` I think this was just an attempt to show he 's a force still to be reckoned with and not a walking-dead politician , '' said Katinka Barysch , deputy director at the Center for European Reform , a London research organization . \n`` For him to come out with his guns blazing does seem a bit odd . '' \nTopolanek 's words , however , underscored a fundamental divide that persists between the United States and many European countries over the best way to respond to the global financial crisis . \nU.S. officials have pressed their European counterparts to spend substantially more public money in an attempt to revive economic growth and global trade . \nSome countries , led by Germany , have strongly resisted , predicting that such a path could lead to unsustainable debts and runaway inflation . \nLuxembourg 's prime minister , Jean-Claude Juncker , who heads a coordinating body of countries that use the euro currency , said European countries had already spent enough to jumpstart their economies . \n`` The European stimulus plans are muscular , they are demanding , they are important in volume and in quality , '' Juncker said Wednesday in an interview with France 's Europe 1 Radio . \nHe said there was `` no question '' that the European Union would reject requests from Obama to spend more . \nObama begins his transatlantic mission next week with a stop in London for a summit of the Group of 20 leading industrialized countries . \nMany European leaders have said the primary goal of the summit should be to impose greater regulation and oversight on global financial markets , instead of more government spending . \nBut the 27 member countries of the European Union have had difficulty expressing themselves with a single voice . \nTopolanek 's speech to the European Parliament angered some legislators , who rebuked him for presuming that all members of the European Union agreed with his harsh criticism of Washington , or the way he delivered it . \n`` You still have n't understood what the job of the E.U. presidency is , '' said Martin Schultz , a German legislator and leader of the Socialist bloc in the Parliament . \nTopolanek rushed back to Prague after his speech to tend to his fallen government . \nOther Czech officials played down his remarks and blamed translators for making them sound harsher than intended . \n`` I was there and listened to the speech in Czech and he never mentioned the word ` hell , ' '' Alexander Vondra , the deputy Czech prime minister , told reporters in Strasbourg . \nCorrespondent Edward Cody in Paris contributed to this report . \nMultimedia reports on the struggle for equality around the globe .",

        "text": "\\* CDC website traffic up sharply this week \\* Random Google search of `` swine flu '' yields 5.4 mln hits By Sue Zeidler and Steve Gorman LOS ANGELES , April 28 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Swine flu chatter spread swiftly through blogs and social network sites like Twitter and Facebook on Tuesday while U.S. cable news networks ' saturation coverage of the outbreak gave way to a major political story . \n`` As the number of swine flu cases continues to climb , so does public interest in the -LRB- flu -RRB- outbreak . \nAmericans are looking for more information on the outbreak and specifically for symptoms to look out for , '' said Heather Hopkins , analyst for Hitwise , which tracks Internet usage . \nOnline searches for the phrase `` swine flu '' during the past week have sent millions of Internet users to Wikipedia , Google and websites of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , according to online tracking experts . \nFor example , a random Google search on the words `` swine flu '' late on Tuesday yielded about 5.4 million hits . \nOnline traffic to www.cdc.gov jumped 442 percent in the week ending April 26 , and `` we are likely to continue to see an increase in Internet visits to the CDC site over the coming days , '' Hopkins said . \nMuch of the online buzz was propelled by social networking sites , said Susannah Fox , associate director at the Pew Research Center 's Internet & American Life Project . \n`` Social media create a hive of information , and we are the bees who are dipping into the hives and then going back into the real world with the information that we find , '' she said . \n`` Some people are really into the hive ... spending a lot of time on Twitter , Facebook and using these social media . '' \nThe new strain of flu has been blamed for as many as 149 deaths in Mexico , while the cases documented in the United States and other countries have been mild by comparison . \nStill , some experts believe the intensity of media coverage has raised the public 's anxiety level . \n`` There 's a distinction between obviously keeping our readers and viewers up to date and sensationalizing the story . \nThe media tends to love doomsday scenarios like bird flu , Y2K -LRB- year-2000 computer scare -RRB- and the guy flying around with TB -LRB- tuberculosis -RRB- , '' said blog publisher Arianna Huffington . \n`` It 's easy for the media to get into panic mode coverage , but very often these things do n't pan out , and the problem is that we 're becoming like the boy who cried wolf , '' she said . \nRobert Thompson , professor of media and popular culture at Syracuse University in New York , agreed that the media has to balance restraint with the imperative of covering an important story . \n`` If as many people had swine flu as those that are covering swine flu then it would be a pandemic to reckon with , '' he said . \nAfter wall-to-wall flu coverage on Monday , the major U.S. cable networks -- CNN , Fox News Channel and MSNBC -- turned much of their attention on Tuesday to U.S. Senator Arlen Specter 's switch from the Republican to the Democratic Party . \n`` Cable news channels have a very hard time covering two different stories simultaneously , '' independent media analyst Andrew Tyndall said . \nMSNBC President Phil Griffin said Monday 's flu coverage was `` event-driven '' by briefings from high-ranking officials , including President Barack Obama , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg . \nBut the networks filled time between news conferences with interviews of public health officials urging people to wash their hands and cover their faces when they sneeze or cough . \n`` The public health authorities know they have these channels available for getting their message out , '' Tyndall said . \n`` There 's not much journalism going on . \nThey 're offering carriage to a message that they 're not controlling very much . '' \nGriffin said news executives are always mindful of the potential for stoking unwarranted public anxiety . \nPew Research 's Fox said those following the story are increasingly turning to the Web and seem headed toward informative rather than sensational sites . \n`` Blogs , Twitter and other social technologies are helping to turn up the volume , but mostly people still get most of their news from mainstream sources , '' she said . \n-LRB- Editing by Frances Kerry and Eric Beech -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform",

May 4 , 2011 at 11:30 am | Report abuse | THAT , in a warfare scenereo such as this is hard . \nIn close quarters combat , it 's nearly impossible given that the rebels are dressed in civvies -LRB- granted often carrying firearms -RRB- . \nThe point a lot of people are trying to make is , when you 're approaching a city that you are A -RRB- 100 % certain has civilians in it , and B -RRB- 100 % certain is under rebel control , you do n't indiscriminately fire cluster and area denial weapons at the target without disregard to who you hit just `` because it 's under OpFor control '' . \nNATO is far from perfect ... it 's precision weapons -LRB- JDAMs , etc -RRB- have blast radii that given the infrastructure ARE going to cause collateral damage . \nBUT the NATO Equiliviant to what 's happening to the rebels would be for a heavy bomber to just fly over Tripoli and carpet bomb the city JUST because there 's targets of opportunity . \nMay 4 , 2011 at 11:48 am | Report abuse | And the fact that the rebels are hiding amongst the civilians means nothing either right ? \nDoes the term '' human shields '' come to mind ? \nMay 4 , 2011 at 12:09 pm | Report abuse | Both sides are amongst civilians , and to varying degrees using `` human shields '' in cowardly attempts , and one reason why it 's good that US and NATO forces are hesitant to join the ground war -LRB- after all , not even NATO forces are 100 % certain what the rebels stand for right now -RRB- . \nTherefore , both Loyalist and Rebel factions are equally guilty on the human shield fascet . \nShould the Rebel forces conduct similar area denial shelling , I 'm sure the emotional environment for their cause would change drastically and they 'd risk losing support . \nSimultaneously , NATO forces do need to take more care in the deployment of precision munitions . \n-LRB- Even a precision strike in a residential area is a HUGE risk that should be weighed far more cautiously -RRB- . \nAll in all , no one is REALLY sure who 's really the ` OpFor ' at this point because it 's gotten so f ` ed up . \nMay 4 , 2011 at 12:22 pm | Report abuse | Creates quite a quandry , does n't it ? \nThe rebels forces have taken to beheading their prisoners . \ndoes n't sound very humane to me . \nSo it seems to me if they 're going to start trying people , it should be on an equal playing field . \nSpottedCat , I 've got to go now . \nThanks for the conversation . \nTalk at you later . \nMay 4 , 2011 at 12:40 pm | Report abuse | May 4 , 2011 at 12:46 pm | Report abuse | Here we go again , al-kida and it 's like meaning France and NATO are bigger criminals than Gadafi . \nIt was his country we invaded and are attempting to impower crimnals who are well armed to over throw a established government . \nThe crime is why was the US involved in a war for oil that 's costing us trillions so France can get the oil from lybia . \nThe bombs that have been dropped have killed thousands but you only report the crimals losses and not the true lybians . \nWhat kind of sick joke is this that several countries team up on one because we do n't like there leader . \nMaybe trying NATO in court would be more approperiot . \nOr let 's try France for invading the Ivory Coast . \nOr try and save Mubarik who surrendered peacfully instead he will get death . \nLet lybia have it 's civil war by itself and not a France installed government . \nPark the drones and leave them to there own vices . \nThe rebels are well armed because NATO has supplied them . \nMay 4 , 2011 at 11:32 am | Report abuse | Police state in full effect at W I U !!! Riot police use sound weapons , tear gas on college students during annual street party . \nU tu be -LRB- mass arrests , tear gas , sound weapons , used on W I U students -RRB- . \nLibya is not a signatory to the ICC . \nGadhafi 's forces should succome to those arrest warrants including all involved in the regime . \nYou can not go after the people trying to stop an uncivilized leader who has been ruthlessly killing and displacing the people of Libya . \nYou do not see NATO bombing Hospitals and and the civilian population , granted you have to take in that in no matter what the situation there will always be the possibility in civillian casualties . \nThe situation could be resolved rather quickly and appropriately if Gadhafi is brought to justice . \nNATO just needs to help out the rebels from the air and let them take out Gadhafi 's regime and let them decide what their government shall become . \nLet the justice system get Gadhafi if the rebels were to fail from the campaign , so that either way the situation is resolved . \nChange it up , fake RUFFNUTT . \nIt 's getting old . \nAre you trying to say Linari , that slaughtering women and children is acceptable as long as it 's being done by NATO aircraft ? \nThat kind of reasoning is sick at best !!! May 4 , 2011 at 3:30 pm | Report abuse | Well , what I see from my perspective is nothin far from the fact that the US and France have conclusively resolved to topple Gadaffi 's regime . \nBut funny thin is , the just do n't know how to openly tell the world that `` We are sick and tired of Gadaffi '' , cos from all indications now , It is the west who is seeking regime change and not Libyan People . \nThe so called rebbels in Libya are jst a face to a body wholy made up of the west and their anger towards Gadaffi . \nI think it 's France & Sarkozy that want to topple Ghadaffi . \nWe have just been asked to pay the piper in return for Iraq . \nObama couldnt say no when he saw the killing of civilians . \nSarkozy believes the Libyans took out that plane in 09 , they are pulling up all of the wreckage hoping to justify their actions against Libya . \nMaybe the black box -LRB- es -RRB- will give them that proof . \nJust my thoughts anyway . \ndesgarrador el panorama de cruentas guerreas todo por tonterias de falsos profetas que se creen Dios is cnn seriously posting an article about whether or not gadaffi commited war crimes ? \nDidnt we already ask that question before we launched hundreds of missiles at him ? \ncomon i want to hear something new Where there is no respect for human life that is a crime . \nI am all for any excuse for killing Arabs ... but my since of fairness over-whelms my lust for dead Arabs . \nIf Nato is holding Libya 's Army at bay and not letting them go door to door to kill the enemy and the only weapon that have is non direct shelling ... then how can you hold them accountable for killing innocent people ? \nAlso if Nato can bomb Libian forces and kill innocent people by accident -- how come they are not held to the same standard . \nA win for Libya -- because nato has removed the no flow zone and will let them fight the rebels up close . \nA win for the Rebels -- because nato is bombing Libya 's army up close . \nA win for the Hague -- because Libya 's army will be tried , convicted and killed in accordance with smart bomb law . \nA win for Me -- More Dead Arabs Now we need to apply this same concept with a country which is a real threat to the USA , IRAN . \n-LRB- required , but will not be displayed -RRB- CNN welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the Rules of Conduct set forth in our Terms of Service . \nComments are not pre-screened before they post . \nYou agree that anything you post may be used , along with your name and profile picture , in accordance with our Privacy Policy and the license you have granted pursuant to our Terms of Service . \nCarnival in Merida , Mexico seems like they favor throwing candy instead of beads ! \nie\\/11BX93W 7:01 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET Could the next pope be from Africa or Latin America ?",
