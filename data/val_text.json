        "text": "The Obama administration is actively discussing the creation of a regulatory commission that would have broad authority to protect consumers who use financial products as varied as mortgages , credit cards and mutual funds , according to several sources familiar with the matter . \nThe proposed commission would be one of the administration 's most significant steps yet to overhaul the financial regulatory system . \nIt would also be one of its first proposals to address causes of the financial crisis such as predatory mortgage lending . \nPlans for a new body remain fluid , but it could be granted broad powers to make sure the terms and marketing of a wide range of loans and other financial products are in the interests of ordinary consumers , sources said . \nSources , who spoke on condition of anonymity because discussions are ongoing , said talks have begun with industry officials , lawmakers and other financial experts about the proposal , which would require legislation . \nLast night , senior policymakers , including Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and National Economic Council Director Lawrence H. Summers , were to discuss the idea at a dinner held at the Treasury Department . \nResponsibility for regulation of consumer financial products is currently distributed among a patchwork of federal agencies . \nSome of these regulators regard consumer protection as a low priority . \nAnd some financial products are not regulated at all . \nThe proposal could centralize enforcement of existing laws and create a vehicle for imposing tougher rules . \nThe idea is likely to face significant opposition from industry groups , which argue that stricter regulation limits the availability of financial products to consumers . \nIt could also trigger a massive regulatory turf war . \nBanking regulators and agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission , which regulates mutual funds , could stand to lose powers , personnel and funding . \nThose agencies are likely to argue they are positioned to protect consumers because they oversee the financial firms directly and have experience writing and enforcing rules governing financial products . \nThe proposal is part of the administration 's broader plan to improve financial regulation . \nOfficials have proposed the creation of a systemic risk regulator whose job would be to spot threats to the health of the overall financial system . \nOfficials also have called for tighter regulation of individual financial firms and markets , including new rules governing hedge funds and derivatives . \nWhile those proposals focus on the guts of the financial system , this new plan would concentrate on the front end -- consumers who borrow money to buy homes and products and who invest their money for retirement , college education and savings . \nThe leading proponent of such a commission is Elizabeth Warren , a Harvard University law professor who now chairs the Congressional Oversight Panel for the government 's financial rescue initiative . \nHer plan is the kernel of the idea the White House is now considering , sources said . \nWarren wrote in a 2007 article in the journal Democracy that the government had failed to protect American consumers in their relationships with financial companies . \n`` It is impossible to buy a toaster that has a one-in-five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house . \nBut it is possible to refinance an existing home with a mortgage that has the same one-in-five chance of putting the family out on the street , '' Warren wrote . \n`` Why are consumers safe when they purchase tangible consumer products with cash , but when they sign up for routine financial products like mortgages and credit cards they are left at the mercy of their creditors ? '' \nWarren proposed creating a new commission modeled on the Consumer Product Safety Commission , which protects buyers of products such as bicycles and baby cribs . \nSuch a commission could be very powerful . \nA number of sweeping federal laws already offer broad protection to consumers of financial products , but those laws have been lightly enforced in recent years . \nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development , for example , has clear authority to crack down on companies that charge excessive closing costs on mortgage loans , but repeatedly postponed planned reforms in the face of industry opposition . \nWarren 's proposal initially found little support in Washington , but the mood has shifted dramatically with the onset of the financial crisis and the election of a Democratic administration . \nIn March , Sen. Richard J. Durbin -LRB- D-Ill . -RRB- \nintroduced legislation to create a commission like the one that Warren had described . \nThe legislation is co-sponsored by Sen. Charles E. Schumer -LRB- D-N.Y. -RRB- and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- . \nThe White House 's support would greatly improve its chances of passing . \nIn proposing the legislation , the senators said that the commission would be responsible for identifying emerging problems and for educating consumers . \nThey were also critical of the existing process . \n`` The Federal Reserve was supposed to do this , but they were asleep at the switch , '' Schumer said at the time . \nStaff writer Neil Irwin contributed to this report .

' \nUsually dolphins were controlled via signals transmitted through a neck harness . \n` The question is , were these dolphins made secure before Katrina struck ? ' \nThe mystery surfaced when a separate group of dolphins was washed from a commercial oceanarium on the Mississippi coast during Katrina . \nEight were found with the navy 's help , but the dolphins were not returned until US navy scientists had examined them . \nSheridan is convinced the scientists were keen to ensure the dolphins were not the navy 's , understood to be kept in training ponds in a sound in Louisiana , close to Lake Pontchartrain , whose waters devastated New Orleans . \nThe navy launched the classified Cetacean Intelligence Mission in San Diego in 1989 , where dolphins , fitted with harnesses and small electrodes planted under their skin , were taught to patrol and protect Trident submarines in harbor and stationary warships at sea . \nCriticism from animal rights groups ensured the use of dolphins became more secretive . \nBut the project gained impetus after the Yemen terror attack on the USS Cole in 2000 . \nDolphins have also been used to detect mines near an Iraqi port .",

        "text": "How new is `` New Labor '' ? \nIn the heady years after 1997 , the ideologues worked hard to promote an image of youth . \nLabor 's troublesome past , they proclaimed , had been thrown overboard along with its commitment to a socialist economy set down in Clause Four of the 1918 constitution . \nIn place of a history , there was a future . \nThe party could now adopt or reject slogans and symbols according to the demands of its current branding strategy . \nHence the appearance of an increasingly bizarre set of stage props starting with `` Cool Britannia '' and climaxing in 2001 with the improbable pink makeover of the British bull-dog . \nBut that was all before 9\\/11 , before the coupling with Bush and the Iraq war . \nNow New Labor talks little about its former flirtations with the young . \nBetter to present itself as the authentic continuation of a social-democratic past . \nThis is the point of Patrick Diamond 's New Labor 's Old Roots -LRB- Imprint Academic , # 14.95 -RRB- , a collection of `` revisionist '' Labor texts running from RH Tawney in 1931 to Gordon Brown in 1997 . \nDiamond is a Downing Street adviser and his claim is strongly endorsed by Tony Blair who now depicts New Labor as `` a party which has returned to its roots '' . \nBut talk of `` roots '' and continuities can also be misleading . \nIt suggests a soft-focus constancy of identity and beliefs that a sharper look at Labor 's history belies . \nWhat chiefly emerges from the brief biographies and memoirs also noticed here - of Aneurin Bevan , Roy Jenkins and Tony Benn - is the sheer diversity encompassed by Labor and its Whig , liberal and puritan forebears . \nTony Benn was born in the middle of the 19th century , the son of a family of journalists , writers and newspaper editors . \nBenn was brought up in an affluent home , the product of a family publishing empire and two generations of engagement in London progressive politics . \nHis father was a Liberal MP who turned to Labor in the 1920s and served in Labor cabinets in 1931 and 1945 . \nThe young Benn grew up with a nurse , cook `` and servants to keep house '' ; he came from a family of Lib-Lab political insiders living next door to Sidney and Beatrice Webb on the site of the present Millbank Tower . \nThe Benns were authentic Puritans . \nEver since the writings of George Eliot and Matthew Arnold , Puritanism has been associated with the provinces , with the energy , ambition yet narrowness of the outsider . \nBut the metropolitan puritanism of the Benns was no less intense . \nThe Benn family were - as Benn still is - teetotal . \nThey were not intellectuals . \nHis parents showed no interest in whether the young Tony read or what he read : `` All my life I have lived in the oral tradition , learning from listening and watching rather than reading . '' \nThis helps to explain why Benn retains such an unruffled belief in a Manichean world in which the forces of good are in perpetual combat with the backsliding and corruption of false friends . \nFrom the Old Testament stories of his mother , Benn learned to honor prophets , not kings . \nIn this picture of politics as a modern day Pilgrim 's Progress , Marx -LRB- despite his atheism -RRB- is honored as `` the last of the Old Testament prophets '' . \nBenn 's parents showed no interest in culture . \nThey lived next door to the Tate Gallery , yet never went inside . \nParsimony was one reason . \nWhen his father once passed the Tate , what clinched his decision not to enter was `` that it would cost him sixpence '' . \nBut what mattered most was not to waste time . \nFrom the 17th century onwards , Puritans were prone to keep diaries in order to justify to God their use of time . \nBenn 's father kept a daily time chart to set down the number of hours he had worked . \nBenn 's own diary-keeping and the assembling of his political life into a huge domestic archive was clearly inspired by his father . \nIf Benn recalls the Puritan inheritance of Labor , Bevan represented the secular revolt against it . \nAlthough his father was an active Baptist as well as treasurer of the local miners ' lodge , neither religion nor the Puritan ethic left much mark upon Bevan . \nIndeed , in later years he combined his socialism with a taste for high living . \nBevan 's education was not a product of home , school or chapel , but of the Central Labor College where he learned Marxian economics and the history of Labor 's struggle . \nLike Benn in the 70s , Bevan in the 50s found himself the leader of a leftwing rebellion within the Labor party . \nBut as Clare and Francis Beckett point out in their lucid short biography , Bevan -LRB- Haus , # 9.99 -RRB- , he was uninterested in the `` self-righteous sectarianism '' in which the Bennites would later wrap themselves . \nFor Bevan the question was `` where was power and which was the road to it '' , a power which he wished to exercise on behalf of `` the working class '' . \nThis attitude resulted not only in the foundation of the National Health Service in 1948 , but in his provision of the best of 20th-century public housing through an insistence on high quality standards in the Housing Act of 1946 . \nIn Labor mythology Jenkins was often considered the polar opposite of Bevan . \nHe was the suave Gaitskellite who split the party and so made possible the triumph of Margaret Thatcher . \nBut the young Jenkins himself was once a Bevanite , only switching to Gaitskell once convinced , like Tony Crosland , that socialism should be identified with equality , rather than public ownership . \nLike Bevan unaffected by religion , Jenkins also presided over the dismantling of the puritan moral code which had governed Britain since the triumph of Evangelicalism in Victorian times . \nBut unlike Bevan , Jenkins was from the beginning a Labor insider -LRB- his father became Attlee 's political secretary -RRB- and received a good formal education culminating in his time at Balliol College , Oxford , where he mixed easily with the children of the privileged classes . \nIn this respect he was an early embodiment of the decline of deference and loosening of social mores which were to become celebrated after 1964 . \nGaitskell had felt disturbed by this trend in the 50s . \nHe associated it with the decline of the old service ethic of the upper middle class : `` Tony -LRB- Crosland -RRB- and Roy are not upper and I sometimes feel they do n't have a proper humility to ordinary working people . '' \nThe receding tide of Puritanism on the one hand , and noblesse oblige on the other , also had its grosser side . \nAlan Watkins recalls that as a young reporter , lunch with a politician often involved `` a large aperitif beforehand , sharing a bottle of wine with the meal and ... brandy afterwards with his coffee . '' \nNew Labor would probably be as appalled as their Edwardian ancestors . \nThe thoughtful accounts found in Roy Jenkins : A Retrospective , edited by Andrew Adonis and Keith Thomas -LRB- OUP , # 18.99 -RRB- , that deal with Jenkins 's detachment from Labor after the electoral defeat of 1970 , read more like a tale of accident and misadventure than of the irresistible rise of a new political force . \nLike Bevan in the 50s , Jenkins was a reluctant rebel . \nBut for Europe and his absence from parliament after the move to Brussels in 1977 , the split with Labor might not have occurred . \nThe much-flagged Dimbleby Lecture of 1979 was anything but epic . \nShirley Williams described it as `` a mildly interesting academic lecture '' . \nBut electoral defeat and the ferocity of internecine party warfare , spearheaded by an intolerant Bennite left , appeared to offer `` the Gang of Four '' no point of return . \nAlready by 1983 , however , after a spirited challenge at the Warrington byelection and victory at Glasgow , Hillhead , Jenkins was suffering from `` battle fatigue '' . \nAnd things only got worse as he found himself confronted by the deviousness of David Steel and the surliness of David Owen , whose `` tough and tender '' program Jenkins dubbed `` sub-Thatcherite '' . \nIt would be easy to point to Jenkins 's personal weaknesses in recounting this unhappy story . \nBut in the end , as the invaluable collection of documents assembled in New Labor 's Old Roots reveals , there was in Labor a collective failure of ethos and aim . \nFor in the crisis which produced Labor 's defeat , Bennism and the SDP , the hallucinating reversion of an infantile left to nationalisation and Europhobia was only a symptom of a wider inability to come to terms with the breakdown of what David Marquand calls `` Keynesian social democracy '' . \nThis was the belief most elegantly encapsulated in Crosland 's 1956 Future of Socialism that increasing equality could be painlessly achieved through a combination of economic growth and high social spending without a fundamental reform of the institutions and assumptions of the existing state . \nThis policy left Labor wholly unprepared to deal with it , and in part even fuelled `` the mounting inflation , swelling balance of payments deficits , unprecedented currency depreciation , rising unemployment , bitter industrial conflict and ebbing governability '' for which the Wilson-Callaghan years are remembered . \nBy republishing the incisive essays of Mackintosh , Marquand , Radice and others , Diamond rightly emphasises that the revision of Croslandite assumptions about social-democracy was as crucial as the need to revise Clause Four . \nBut to get the full measure of this problem which still lurks just beneath the surface of New Labor , we need to set it in a longer time-frame . \nFor `` revisionism '' did not begin in 1994 , not even with Gaitskell in 1960 , but at least as far back as 1918 . \nLabor before 1914 did not aspire to power . \nIt was a party committed to defend the trade unions ' right to organise and secure parliamentary representation . \nCommitment to public ownership in 1918 was a `` revision '' put forward not by utopians or Marxists , but by sober-minded Fabians and hard-headed trade union leaders , convinced - as was Lenin - by the practical successes of state control of wartime industry . \nDuring the inter-war years and well into the 40s , there was no Labor intellectual , be it Tawney , Durbin , Dalton or Gaitskell , who did not believe in the superiority of a planned economy with a large measure of public ownership . \nBut public ownership was not the defining point of socialism . \nIt only became so during the 50s when Bevan equated it with a commitment to Clause Four in contrast to Crosland 's emphasis upon equality . \nIf these were the decisive doctrinal turning points in Labor 's history before 1960 , the period between Gaitskell and `` New Labor '' delivered a massive blow to each of these three possible foundations for Labor advance : first , the assumption crucial to Clause Four , that socialist planned economies were superior , widely believed in the 30s and still present in the Labor National Plan of 1964 , disappeared in the following 20 years as the economic inefficiency of Soviet communism became increasingly apparent . \nSecond , the privileged legal position of trade unions , first established in the 1870s and reinforced by the foundation of the Labor party in 1900 , was discredited by trade union militancy in `` the winter of discontent '' and dismantled by Thatcher and Norman Tebbit in the bitter aftermath of the 1983 miners ' strike . \nLastly , Keynesian assumptions about economic management upon which Crosland 's egalitarian strategy depended were destroyed by the economic crises of the 1970s . \nSeen in this way , it becomes clear that `` New Labor '' is not really new ; yet equally clear that `` the roots '' to which the party might wish to return are frail or no longer existent . \nThe question that destroyed the coherence and ultimately the existence of the SDP was what to put in place of the defense of the trade unions , Clause Four or Crosland 's vision of equality . \nSo far , `` New Labor '' has managed to keep this question at bay , just as Harold Wilson deferred the question of Clause Four for more than a decade . \nIt has done so by good economic management , by the wooing of middle England through the black arts of triangulation and spin , and by the modest , but real commitment to the reduction of poverty , both nationally and internationally . \nBut should the bad times ever return - Iraq and possible economic downturn suggest they might - `` New Labor '' would do well to start thinking now about an alternative basis for a politics of equality . \nGareth Stedman Jones 's book An End to Poverty ? \nis published by Profile .",

        "text": "BP oil spill - the static kill explained Procedure pumps heavy mud and cement through blow-out preventer to force oil back down Macondo well Tuesday 3 August 2010 13.49 BST This BP image shows the original ` top kill ' procedure in operation , a maneuvre never before tried 5,000 ft underwater Photograph : Associated Press After three months of trying to stem the oil flow gushing from the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico and becoming responsible for the largest accidental oil spill in history , BP hopes its `` static kill '' method will seal it once and for all . \nStatic kill is similar to the top kill method that BP attempted to use back in May . \nThe procedure works by essentially pumping heavy mud and cement through the blow-out preventer and into the well . \nThe idea being that the mud is so dense that it will suffocate the flow of oil , forcing it back down the well into the reservoir . \n-LRB- See graphic -RRB- . \nIn a recent technical update , Kent Wells , BP senior vice-president , said the key difference between top kill and static kill is that during the top kill the well was flowing . \n`` We had to pump at tremendous rates and pressures to overcome that , '' he said . \n`` Today we have the well shut in , we do n't have that flow we have to overcome , so we can go at very slow rates , very little additional pressure above what the well shut-in pressure already is . \n`` It 's a much more controlled fashion . '' \nThe heavy drilling mud , which weighs about 13lb per gallon , will be pumped to the seabed from a ship , and through a manifold a device that controls the mud flow before being forced down into the well through the blow-out preventer . \nIf the mud successfully smothers the oil , BP could then pump concrete down into the well in a bid to seal it . \nThe company will conduct an `` injectivity test '' this morning , and if successful could attempt the static kill this afternoon . \nAlthough , a spokesman warned that the procedure could take a few hours but might take `` much longer '' . \nFinally , sealing the well would represent an enormous relief for beleaguered BP executives . \nThe flow of oil was first stemmed on 15 July , when the company fitted a cap to the blow-out preventer . \nThe cap prevented leaking oil for the first time since 20 April , ending three months of attempted shut-off procedures . \nBP 's initial efforts to contain the spill focused on trapping and burning the oil on the water surface , while repairing the blow-out preventer , so it could shut off the flow . \nWhen this failed in late April , the company began to drill two relief wells , but warned they would take two to three months to become operational . \nWhile beginning this drilling , the company successfully stemmed one of the three leaks by attaching a valve to the end of the crippled drilling pipe , and after constructing three huge cofferdams or containment domes tried to lower one over the main source of the leak . \nIn early May , the cofferdam failed due to a build up of crystallised gas , and as the oil began to wash ashore , BP focused instead on trying to capture some of the leaking oil , rather than stopping the flow all at once . \nAt the end of May , the terms `` top kill '' and `` junk shot '' entered the worldwide vernacular , as BP tried to force heavy mud , and later golf balls and bits of tyre through the blow-out preventer . \nIt did n't work , and in early June , BP turned to capping the well , with some success , before replacing the original cap with a tighter fitting one , sealing the well , in July .",

'' \nShe said that at least 10 people had been killed and at least 30 others wounded . \nBut figures were difficult to confirm ; CNN was not in the city . \nA resident of Misrata who asked to be identified only as Mohammed said Monday that six people were killed in the morning . \nBuilding frequented by Gadhafi hit A doctor at a hospital in Misrata put the number of dead Sunday at 16 , with 71 wounded . \nThe indiscriminate shelling began after rebel forces routed forces loyal to leader Moammar Gadhafi from the city center early Sunday , Colvin said . \nThe rout came after rebels moved from building to building along Tripoli Street , the main boulevard , ousting government forces , she said . \nTwenty-five rebels were killed in one day , and an undetermined number of Gadhafi soldiers were killed , she said . \nAsked about the rebel army , she laughed . \n`` We 're talking about an army of shopkeepers , engineers , car mechanics , '' she said . \n`` Very , very few trained military . '' \nAt the fruit and vegetable market , government tanks that had been hidden under loading bays were set afire over the weekend . \nTheir position there underscored the difficulty of NATO airstrikes in discriminating between government forces and civilians . \nSince then , stationed on the city 's edge , government forces have been firing shells randomly into residential neighborhoods of the city , she said . \n`` It 's a free-fire zone on civilians , '' she said from the hospital , where she said she had seen casualties that ranged `` from loss of limbs to an 8-year-old boy struck in the ankle by shrapnel . \nHe 'll keep the foot , but he was in bad shape . '' \nOutside , a white tent served as a triage area ; a refrigerator truck was packed with bodies . \nWhen two people were killed in one house , the family got into a car , but it too was hit , killing a man and two children , she said . \nAlmost all of the shops in the city were shut , she said . \nAlong Tripoli Street , `` every single building has been hit by shells . '' \nSome bakery owners were giving away bread , and a few stores on the other side of town remained open , she said . \nAs of Monday night , the seaside city remained surrounded on three sides , she said . \nLast week , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Khaim said that Gadhafi 's military was withdrawing from Misrata and that tribal leaders would deal with the rebels . \nBut rebel commanders told Colvin that there were no negotiations going on between them and tribal leaders , the reporter said . \nThe government 's assertion that such talks were ongoing `` appears to be a fig leaf or Gadhafi trying to cover the fact that his troops have been defeated , '' Colvin said . \nMisrata has been the scene of some of the deadliest battles of the war as rebels attempt to oust Gadhafi , who has been in power for 42 years . \nAt least 36 people were killed there Sunday , rebel spokesman Col. Ahmad Bani said Monday . \nIn all , hundreds of people have been killed in the battle for the city , which has been under siege by Gadhafi 's forces for seven weeks . \nIts population of about 450,000 makes it the country 's third-largest city . \nBut that number has been dropping as residents have sought to get out . \nOn Monday , the International Organization for Migration said it had taken nearly 1,000 stranded migrants -- most of them from Nigeria -- and 17 civilian casualties from Misrata to Benghazi on Sunday , with more such efforts planned . \nThe accounts of dire conditions in Misrata came as a government official said Gadhafi was well and in command of the country 's affairs , despite what the official called a NATO attempt to kill him by bombing his compound in the capital city of Tripoli . \n`` The message that was sent by NATO in the early hours of this morning was sent to the wrong address , '' Mussa Ibrahim said in a written statement . \nIn a tour of the aftermath , Ibrahim said the flattened structure was a civilian office building . \nIn a statement , NATO said the target was a communications center in central Tripoli that had been used to coordinate attacks against civilians . \nNATO is leading an international military operation in Libya that includes airstrikes targeting Gadhafi 's military resources . \nIt is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilians . \nOn Monday , Italy 's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi called U.S. President Barack Obama to tell him of his decision to provide additional military support by authorizing air-to-ground strikes on Libyan regime targets , the White House said in a statement . \n`` The two leaders agreed that additional pressure is necessary to strengthen the civilian protection mission , and the president emphasized that the best way to ensure the safety of the Libyan people is for Gadhafi to leave power , '' the statement said . \nLibyan state TV said military and civilian casualties resulted from the strike on Gadhafi 's Bab el-Azizia compound . \n`` We have no independent means of verifying reports of possible civilian casualties , '' NATO said in a statement on its website . \nNATO has been issuing warnings to Libyan civilians to stay away from military sites and equipment , especially around Misrata . \nCiting a military source , state-run Libyan TV reported late Monday that NATO ships struck an offshore fiber-optic cable , cutting communications to Sirte , Ras Lanuf and al-Brega . \nIt also reported that air strikes hit targets Monday night in Zawiya and Ayn Zarah of Tripoli district , resulting in casualties . \nSince NATO took command of Operation Unified Protector on March 31 , its aircraft have flown more than 3,700 sorties and more than 1,500 strike sorties . \nOver the weekend , NATO aircraft destroyed multiple-rocket launchers , armored personnel carriers , bunkers and storage facilities in and around Misrata , Tripoli and Sirte , the alliance said . \n`` We are bringing all our capabilities to bear on all parts of the Gadhafi regime that remain intent on harming the civilian population , '' NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said in a statement . \n`` As decided by the foreign ministers of NATO and operational partners , we will keep up the pressure until all attacks against civilians have stopped , Gadhafi 's forces have withdrawn to bases , and full and unimpeded humanitarian access has been ensured . '' \nThe rebels , under the umbrella of the Transitional National Council , received a pledge Sunday from Kuwait for about $ 180 million . \nThe announcement came during council chief Mustafa Abdel Jalil 's visit to Kuwait , Kuwaiti state-run television reported . \nCNN 's Kamal Ghattas , Barbara Starr , Kareem Khadder , Frederik Pleitgen , Reza Sayah and Saad Abedine contributed to this report .",

        "text": "HONG KONG | Tue May 12 , 2009 8:56 am EDT HONG KONG -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A leading virologist has described the new H1N1 influenza virus as `` very unstable , '' meaning it could mix and swap genetic material when exposed to other viruses . \nThe new virus , which has infected 5,251 people in 30 countries and killed 61 , has displayed great efficiency in spreading among people , said Guan Yi , a microbiologist with the University of Hong Kong . \n`` This virus has been around only a few months , it is very unstable ... and we know that its presence is dramatically increasing in human population , so the chance of it meeting with H5N1 is actually increased , '' Guan said in an interview on Tuesday . \n`` Both H1N1 and H5N1 are unstable so the chances of them exchanging genetic material are higher , whereas a stable -LRB- seasonal flu -RRB- virus is less likely to take on genetic material . '' \nWhile H1N1 appears to be mild so far with many infected people recovering even without treatment , the H5N1 has a mortality rate of between 60 to 70 percent . \nExperts are fearful about the emergence of a hybrid which combines the killing power of the H5N1 with the efficient transmissibility of H1N1 . \nH5N1 is believed to be endemic in countries like China , Indonesia , Vietnam and Egypt . \nGuan , an expert on both the H5N1 and SARS , has analyzed the genetic sequences of the new virus , which is a triple reassortant containing genetic material from swine , human and bird . \nHe said there was a huge information gap due to a lack of regular surveillance on animal disease . \nEach one of the eight gene segments in the new virus has been seen in pigs in the past 10 years , but experts have no clue when this new H1N1 virus strain first appeared and in which animal species it had been incubating , Guan said . \n`` We know when each gene segment appeared , but we do n't know when this strain first appeared , there is an information gap of about five to 10 years , from 1999 to 2009 . \nIf there was regular surveillance , we would know when this virus came about , '' he said . \n`` We do n't know if this reassortment happened in pigs or human ... It 's likely to have come from pigs because all the segments have been found in pigs , but we ca n't be 100 percent sure . '' \nGuan backed stringent moves taken by some governments to keep the virus at bay , such as quarantining . \n`` They are useful because we are now fighting for time to develop vaccines and antivirals , which will then minimize its impact on people -LRB- over the longer term -RRB- , '' he said . \n`` Already it appears to more virulent than seasonal flu because it is killing younger people and it appears to have higher mortality than seasonal flu , so it does n't make sense to treat this like seasonal flu . '' \nSeasonal flu kills about 250,000 to 500,000 people annually with a fatality rate of less than 0.1 percent . \nA study published in Science on Monday estimated that the new H1N1 flu virus has a case fatality ratio of 0.4 percent based on confirmed and suspected deaths . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform",

        "text": "The worst financial crisis since the Great Depression is claiming another casualty : American-style capitalism . \nSince the 1930s , U.S. banks were the flagships of American economic might , and emulation by other nations of the fiercely free-market financial system in the United States was expected and encouraged . \nBut the market turmoil that is draining the nation 's wealth and has upended Wall Street now threatens to put the banks at the heart of the U.S. financial system at least partly in the hands of the government . \nThe Bush administration is considering a partial nationalization of some banks , buying up a portion of their shares to shore them up and restore confidence as part of the $ 700 billion government bailout . \nThe notion of government ownership in the financial sector , even as a minority stakeholder , goes against what market purists say they see as the foundation of the American system . \nYet the administration may feel it has no choice . \nCredit , the lifeblood of capitalism , ceased to flow . \nAn economy based on the free market can not function that way . \nThe government 's about-face goes beyond the banking industry . \nIt is reasserting itself in the lives of citizens in ways that were unthinkable in the era of market-knows-best thinking . \nWith the recent takeovers of major lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the bailout of AIG , the U.S. government is now effectively responsible for providing home mortgages and life insurance to tens of millions of Americans . \nMany economists are asking whether it remains a free market if the government is so deeply enmeshed in the financial system . \nGiven that the United States has held itself up as a global economic model , the change could shift the balance of how governments around the globe conduct free enterprise . \nOver the past three decades , the United States led the crusade to persuade much of the world , especially developing countries , to lift the heavy hand of government from finance and industry . \nBut the hands-off brand of capitalism in the United States is now being blamed for the easy credit that sickened the housing market and allowed a freewheeling Wall Street to create a pool of toxic investments that has infected the global financial system . \nHeavy intervention by the government , critics say , is further robbing Washington of the moral authority to spread the gospel of laissez-faire capitalism . \nThe government could launch a targeted program in which it takes a minority stake in troubled banks , or a broader program aimed at the larger banking system . \nIn either case , however , the move could be seen as evidence that Washington remains a slave to Wall Street . \nThe plan , for instance , may not compel participating firms to give their chief executives the salary haircuts that some in Congress intended . \nBut if the plan did n't work , the government might have to take bigger stakes . \n`` People around the world once admired us for our economy , and we told them if you wanted to be like us , here 's what you have to do -- hand over power to the market , '' said Joseph Stiglitz , the Nobel Prize-winning economist at Columbia University . \n`` The point now is that no one has respect for that kind of model anymore given this crisis . \nAnd of course it raises questions about our credibility . \nEveryone feels they are suffering now because of us . '' \nIn Seoul , many see American excess as a warning . \nAt the same time , anger is mounting over the global spillover effect of the U.S. crisis . \nThe Korean currency , the won , has fallen sharply in recent days as corporations there struggle to find dollars in the heat of a global credit crunch . \n`` Derivatives and hedge funds are like casino gambling , '' said South Korean Finance Minister Kang Man-soo . \n`` A lot of Koreans are asking , how can the United States be so weak ? '' \nOther than a few fringe heads of state and quixotic headlines , no one is talking about the death of capitalism . \nThe embrace of free-market theories , particularly in Asia , has helped lift hundreds of millions out of poverty in recent decades . \nBut resentment is growing over America 's brand of capitalism , which in contrast to , say , Germany 's , spurns regulations and venerates risk .",
